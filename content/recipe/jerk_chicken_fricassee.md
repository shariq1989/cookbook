* 2 tsp Paprika
* 2 tsp Salt
* 1 tsp Coarse Black Pepper 
* ½ tsp Red Pepper Flakes
* ½ tsp Cumin, ground
* ½ tsp Nutmeg, ground
* ½ tsp Cinnamon, ground
* 1 tsp Thyme, dried
* 1 tbsp Parsley, dried

For the Fricassee

* 4 tbsp Jamaican Jerk Seasoning, divided 
* Kosher Salt and Black Pepper, to taste 
* 3 lb Bone-in, Skin-on Chicken Thigh, trimmed and patted dry
* 1 tbsp Canola Oil 
* 1 medium Yellow Onion, thinly sliced

* 1 tbsp Soy Sauce 
* 1 tbsp Lime Juice 
* Lime Wedges for garnish 

#### INSTRUCTIONS 

1. In a small bowl, combine ingredients for the jerk seasoning and set aside (any leftovers will store for up to 3 months in a sealed mason jar).
2. In another bowl, combine 2 tbsp jerk seasoning with salt and pepper and season the chicken with the mixture.
3. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil until shimmering. Add half of the chicken, skin down, and cook until golden brown, 7-10 minutes.
4. Transfer the chicken, skin-up, to a plate. Repeat until all of the chicken has had a chance to brown. 
5. Pour off and discard all but 2 tbsp fat from the skillet.
6. Add the onion, scallion whites, Gochujang Sauce, and remaining jerk seasoning to the pan. Cook over medium heat until onions soften and turn lightly brown.
7. Stir in soy sauce, lime juice, and 1 cup of water, bring to a simmer, scraping up any brown bits at this time.
8. Return the chicken to the skillet, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for about 20 minutes.
9. Transfer the chicken to a serving platter. Cook the liquid over medium-high heat, stirring regularly until the liquid thickens, 7-10 minutes.
10. Remove from heat, taste, and season with salt and pepper.
11. Pour the mixture over the chicken, garnish it with the scallion greens, and serve with lime wedges.

### ABOUT THIS MEAL 

You will absolutely love this jerk chicken fricassee, also called Jamaican brown stew. It gets it name from the rich, brown color of the dish. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Jerk Seasoning 

* Chicken Thighs: I use bone-in and skin-on chicken thighs because they are high in flavor and full of fat. You can use boneless thighs, chicken legs, or a combination.

* [Gochujang](https://amzn.to/3al2a8Y): Gochujang is not a typical ingredient used in fricassee, but I used it in place of the more traditional ketchup. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* 2 small bowls 
* A large skillet
