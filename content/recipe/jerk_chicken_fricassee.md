#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Jerk Seasoning:

* 1 tbsp Onion Powder
* 1 tbsp Garlic Powder
* 2 tsp Cayenne Pepper
* 2 tsp Paprika
* 2 tsp Salt
* 1 tbsp Black Pepper, coarse ground 
* ½ tsp Red Pepper Flakes
* ½ tsp Cumin, ground
* ½ tsp Nutmeg, ground
* 1 tbsp Cinnamon, ground
* 1 tsp Thyme, dried
* 1 tbsp Parsley, dried

For the Fricassee:

* 4 tbsp Jamaican Jerk Seasoning, divided 
* 3 lb Chicken Thighs, boneless and skinless, trimmed and patted dry
* 1 tbsp Avocado Oil 
* 1 medium Yellow Onion, thinly sliced 
* 1/2 Green Bell Pepper, thinly sliced 
* 4 Scallions, thinly sliced, whites and greens reserved separately 
* 2 tbsp [Gochujang](https://amzn.to/3al2a8Y)
* 1 tbsp Soy Sauce 
* 1 tbsp Lime Juice 

#### INSTRUCTIONS 

1. In a small bowl, combine ingredients for the jerk seasoning and set aside (any leftovers will store for up to 3 months in a sealed mason jar).
2. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil until shimmering. Add half of the chicken, skin down, and cook until golden brown, 7-10 minutes.
3. Transfer the chicken, skin-up, to a plate. Repeat until all of the chicken has had a chance to brown. 
4. Pour off and discard all but 2 tbsp fat from the skillet.
5. Add the onion, scallion whites, Gochujang Sauce, and remaining jerk seasoning to the pan. Cook over medium heat until onions soften and turn lightly brown.
6. Stir in soy sauce, lime juice, and 1 cup of water, bring to a simmer, scraping up any brown bits at this time.
7. Return the chicken to the skillet, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for about 20 minutes.
8. Transfer the chicken to a serving platter. Cook the liquid over medium-high heat, stirring regularly until the liquid thickens, 7-10 minutes.
9. Remove from heat, taste, and season with salt and pepper.
10. Pour the mixture over the chicken, garnish it with the scallion greens, and serve with lime wedges.

### ABOUT THIS MEAL 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Jerk Seasoning: I use this homemade combination of spices for my jerk chicken recipes, but you could also go the store-bought route. 

* Chicken Thighs: I use boneless and skinless chicken thighs, but this dish is more traditionally made with a broken down whole chicken or thighs that are bone-in and skin-on. Whatever cut of chicken you end up with, be sure to adjust the cooking time accordingly. The safe cooking temperature for chicken is 160 degrees. 

* [Gochujang](https://amzn.to/3al2a8Y): Gochujang is not a common ingredient in a fricassee, but I use it in place of the more traditional ketchup and it is phenomenal. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A small bowl
* A large saute pan with a lid
