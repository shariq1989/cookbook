### ABOUT THE MEAL 

Kedjenou, pronounced (KED-gen-ooh), is popular in the Ivory Coast, known for its savory, slow-cooked stews. This dish traditionally cooks in a clay pot, called a Canary or Canari, over an open flame. Cooking in a sealed Canary allows the chicken to slow cook in the juices, spices, vegetables, and rich aromatics. Little to no liquid is added resulting in a highly flavorful and concentrated dish. The word kedjenou means to move or shake, and refers to the practice of shaking the Canary side to side several times throughout the cooking process to prevent sticking or burning inside the sealed clay pot. I do not have access to a Canary, but I achieve a similar result using a [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3sgQtGK) or [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ). Enjoy this kedjenou recipe our family loves.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken: Use bone-in and skin-on thighs, legs, or a combination of the two. You could also break down a whole chicken and use that for a stew. 

* Vegetables: I use tomatoes, onions, green bell pepper, garlic cloves, carrots, and eggplant. 

* Kedjenou Spice Blend: Like all good spice blends, Kedjenou varies from home to home. This recipe contains the spice blend we use in our home.  

* Chicken Broth: I use [Better than Bouillion](https://amzn.to/3rR71VA) to flavor the dish; if you prefer, use [Maggi](https://amzn.to/3pauBhp), a popular ingredient in Ivorian cuisine. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* An [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) or [Dutch Oven](https://amzn.to/3sgQtGK) 

#### What variations of kedjenou can I try? 

Chicken is most often used to make kedjenou, but you could try this same recipe with beef, lamb, goat, fish, and other seafood. Also, feel free to experiment some with the vegetables. The most common vegetables are tomato, onion, bell pepper, and eggplant. Other vegetables you could include are carrots, green onion, potatoes, and okra. 

Some popular variations of kedjenou include: 
* Kedjenou de poulet

#### Can I freeze kedjenou?

You sure can. First, allow the dish to cool completely. Then, add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. Kedjenou can freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm on the stovetop, and enjoy!
