### ABOUT THE MEAL

Kedjenou is popular in the Ivory Coast, a place known for its savory, slow-cooked stews. This dish is traditionally cooked in a clay pot, called a canary. Using the canary allows the chicken to slow cook in all of the juices and spices. The word "kedjenou," means, "to shake," which is why the stew is shaken a few times throughout the cooking process, to prevent sticking or burning, but without being disturbed. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Whole Chicken: Break down the whole chicken. I prefer to use a combination of bone-in thighs and drumsticks.

* Vegetables: I use tomato, onion, carrot, and potato in the stew. You can also include green onion, bell pepper, and eggplant. Eggplant is especially common. 

* Kedjenou Spice Blend: Like all good spice blends, Kedjenou varies from home to home. This recipe contains the spice blend we use. The leftover spice blend can last for three months if stored in a sealed mason jar. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* An [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) or [Dutch Oven](https://amzn.to/3sgQtGK) 

#### Can I freeze Kedjenou?

You sure can. First, allow the dish to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container. Kedjenou can freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm on the stovetop, and enjoy!
