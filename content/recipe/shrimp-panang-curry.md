* 1 medium Yellow Onion, roughly chopped
* 1 Red Bell Pepper, roughly chopped 
* 3 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 1 1/2 can Full-Fat [Coconut Milk](https://amzn.to/3hRQ6OY), plus more if you prefer less spicy

2. In a [Dutch oven](https://amzn.to/2UeXCLz) or a heavy-bottomed pan like a [wok](https://amzn.to/3cQualy), warm the Panang curry paste and coconut oil until fragrant, about 2 minutes.

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

This Panang curry recipe is the perfect quick and easy weeknight meal. The flavor is creamy, tangy, and sweet, and it is excellent alongside some perfectly cooked rice. This recipe is completely customizable and can easily fit a vegetarian or vegan diet with a few omissions.

#### What ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Jumbo Shrimp: I used jumbo shrimp for this recipe, but you can use extra-large or colossal shrimp if you want something more filling. 

* [Panang Curry Paste](https://amzn.to/3wLObSf): When it comes to Thai curry paste, we have tried them all; [Maestra's](https://amzn.to/35DP0AQ) flavor is by far the best. It is also one of the few Thai curry pastes that are vegetarian and vegan friendly, so that is a bonus. [Mae Ploy](https://amzn.to/3gH85bv) is also pretty tasty. 

* Coconut Oil

* Yellow Onion

* Red Bell Pepper

* Garlic 

* [Coconut Milk](https://amzn.to/3hRQ6OY): Coconut milk is a staple in Thai cooking, but be sure to use [full-fat coconut milk](https://amzn.to/3hRQ6OY) for the perfect consistency. 

* Shiitake Mushrooms

* Keffir Lime Leaves 

* [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/3d3z0vF)

* Thai Basil
