#### STOVE-TOP INSTRUCTIONS 

For the Roasted Eggplant: 

1. Rinse the eggplants and pat them dry. Then, make three slits on either side of each eggplant with a knife and tuck a few garlic cloves into the slits. I usually use about 4-5 garlic cloves. 
2. Brush the eggplants with oil and add them to a skewer. Put the eggplant directly on heat (gas oven or grill) and roast. Cook for 10-12 minutes, and flip halfway through. 
3. Check to see if the eggplants are done by inserting a knife into the eggplant; it should go through with ease. Use a pair of tongs to remove the eggplant from heat and wrap it in aluminum foil to cool.
4. Once cooled, remove the skin. 
5. Transfer the roasted eggplant and garlic to a bowl and mash using a fork. Set it aside.

For the Baingan Bharta: 

1. Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Then add the cumin seeds. Cook until they begin to sputter. 
2. Next, add in the onion and cook until the onions become translucent and soften, about 8-10 minutes. 
3. Add the tomatoes, garlic, and ginger to the mixture. Cook for about 5 minutes until the tomatoes release liquid. 
4. Combine the mashed roasted eggplant and mix well. Use a meat chopper or potato masher to break up the tomatoes and eggplant even more. You can leave it chunky if you prefer it that way. 
5. In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, coriander powder, and salt. Add the spices and the water to the pan and stir to combine. Cook for another 5-10 minutes on medium heat
6. Stir in the cilantro and remove the pan from heat.
7. Season with salt, to taste. Serve with long-grained basmati rice or fresh roti. 

 
### ABOUT THE MEAL

Baingan bharta is a dish from North India, made by mashing roasted vegetables and then flavoring them with rich spices.

Not a fan of eggplant? Cool, me either, but I love this dish! I will never forget the first time my mother-in-law made it for me. I had always been an eggplant-hater; it's the texture for me. However, the smoky roasted flavor from the eggplant and garlic mixed with the fragrant spices completely changed my mind. This is now one of my favorite dishes.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Eggplant: You can use any eggplant variation. I recommend using Indian eggplants. 

* Garlic: The combination of fresh garlic and roasted garlic flavors the bharta well. 

* Tomatoes: Tomatoes make the gravy, which binds the eggplant to the rest of the bharta. 

* Warm Spices: I use a mixture of cumin seeds, Kashmiri chili powder, coriander powder, and salt to season this dish. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* Skewers to roast over a grill or gas stove  
* A medium skillet 

#### Is baingan bharta vegetarian? Is it vegan?

This dish is both vegetarian and vegan-friendly. 

#### Can I freeze baingan bharta?

Yes, allow the baingan bharta to cool and prepare a freezer-safe resealable bag. Scoop the leftovers into the bag, making sure to leave a few inches of space so the dish can expand if needed. Squeeze out as much air as you can before sealing the bag. Baingan bharta will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your sides.
