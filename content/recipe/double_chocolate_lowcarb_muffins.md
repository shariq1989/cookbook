### How to Make Double Chocolate Low-Carb Muffins 

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 2 cups [Almond Flour](https://amzn.to/3r1D3P6)
* ¾ cup Unsweetened [Cocoa Powder](https://amzn.to/3ANnCyp)
* ½ cup [Monkfruit Sweetener](https://amzn.to/3hZP1Vc)
* 2 tsp Baking Powder
* ¼ tsp Salt
* ½ cup Butter, melted
* ¼ cup Unsweetened Almond Milk
* 3 large Eggs, beaten
* 1 tsp [Vanilla Extract](https://amzn.to/3lgbOyw)
* ¾ cup Sugar-Free [Chocolate Chips](https://amzn.to/3xBdbfi)
  
#### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2. Line a [muffin tin](https://amzn.to/3p4IfkN) with [muffin liners](https://amzn.to/3D289uv).
3. In a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3HYetXr), combine the dry ingredients.
4. Then, stir in the melted butter, beaten eggs, vanilla, and almond milk one by one. Careful not to overmix.
5. Add the chocolate chips and fold them into the batter using a spatula. 
6. The batter will be thick and dense, so use a spoon to divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin liners. Top each one with a few chocolate chips. 
7. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until cooked through. 
8. Remove the muffins from the oven and remove each muffin from the tins immediately using a fork.

### ABOUT THE MUFFINS

#### What main ingredients do I need for these muffins?

* [Almond Flour](https://amzn.to/3r1D3P6)

* Unsweetened [Cocoa Powder](https://amzn.to/3ANnCyp) 

* Sweetener: I use [monkfruit](https://amzn.to/3hZP1Vc) in this recipe for a few reasons. We always have it on hand, and it is the only sweetner that doesn't leave me with a strange after-taste. 
 
* Baking Powder 

* Salt 

* Butter: Melted butter compliments the almond flour, which will easily dry out your baked goods if not paired well. 

* Unsweetened Almond Milk 

* Eggs 

* [Vanilla Extract](https://amzn.to/3lgbOyw)

* Sugar-Free Chocolate Chips: I used Lily's sugar-free [chocolate chips](https://amzn.to/3xBdbfi), but you could also use cacao nibs if you prefer. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [muffin tin](https://amzn.to/3p4IfkN)
* A set of [muffin liners](https://amzn.to/3D289uv)
* A [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3HYetXr)
