### ABOUT THE MUFFINS

#### What main ingredients do I need for these muffins?

* Almond Flour
* Cocoa Powder 
* Sweetener: I use Monkfruit in this recipe for a few reasons. Concerning sugar-free sweeteners, Monkfruit is something we always have on hand and it is the only one that doesn't leave me with a strange after-taste.  
* Baking Powder 
* Salt 
* Butter: Melted butter compliments the almond flour, which will easily dry out your baked goods if not paired well. 
* Almond Milk 
* Eggs 
* Vanilla Extract 
* Sugar-Free Chocolate Chips: I used Lily's sugar-free chocolate chips, but you could also use cacao nibs if you prefer. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A muffin tin 
* Muffin liners
* A large bowl
