#### ABOUT THE MEAL

Butter chicken originated in Dehli, and it quickly grew in popularity throughout the rest of the world. It makes sense; butter chicken introduces the flavor and spices of Indian cooking in one tasty dish. For that reason, I often make this meal for those who have never tasted Indian food before. My creamy, homemade butter chicken recipe can be made in the Instant Pot or the stove-top and tastes just like your favorite restaurant. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken: I use boneless chicken thighs, but you can use chicken breasts if you prefer. 

* Butter: I recommend splurging for high-quality butter, like Kerrygold, for this recipe since butter is central to the dish.

* Cream: I use heavy cream because it blends well with the other ingredients without being temperamental. 

* Garam Masala: India is a vast country with varying sub-cultures. As a result, Indian food differs from region to region. The same is true of spices as well. Garam masala is a necessary ingredient for butter chicken;  but, each garam masala blend differs based on origin and the family making it. For this reason, I suggest making your garam masala, so you can control the amount of each spice used in the mixture and cater it specifically to your preferences. Here is the [garam masala](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/pakistani_garam_masala/) our family uses. If you choose to go the store-bought route, I suggest [Rani](https://amzn.to/3eqFSFa), Spice House, or Penzey's garam masala. 

* Tomatoes: I use fresh ingredients whenever possible, but you can also use canned, diced tomatoes instead. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3rgDbMW)
* A [heavy-bottomed pan](https://amzn.to/3FUiFpe)
* A [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3xJeucx) or [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/2Qb5T1j)
* A [food processor](https://amzn.to/2RnWnYY), [blender](https://amzn.to/3efJY2z), or [immersion blender](https://amzn.to/30O0Ndo)

#### Can butter chicken be vegetarian? Can it be vegan? Can it be dairy-free? 

You can easily modify this recipe to fit a vegetarian, vegan, or dairy-free way of eating. 

* Vegetarian: First, we need to find a substitute for the chicken in this recipe. I recommend using chickpeas, baked firm tofu, paneer, or roasted cauliflower. For added protein, you can also include toasted cashews. If using cashews, add them when you add the onions. 

* Vegan: I prefer using chickpeas, baked firm tofu, or roasted cauliflower in place of chicken. They come out delicious and hold up well throughout the cooking process. For added protein, you can also include toasted cashews. If using cashews, add them when you add the onions. In place of butter, use either coconut oil or vegan butter, and you can use full-fat coconut milk as an alternative to the cream.

* Dairy-Free: In place of butter and cream, use coconut oil and full-fat [coconut milk](https://amzn.to/2ODAyDS).  

#### Is butter chicken keto or low-carb?

Yes, it is. I even calculated the macros to make it easier for you. The serving size for these macros is one chicken thigh and 1/3 cup of sauce.  

* CARBS: 5 Net Carbs
* PROTEIN: 26g
* FAT: 41g

To finish your low-carb meal, I recommend serving butter chicken with a side of cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, or keto naan. 

#### Can I freeze butter chicken?

Yes, first allow the dish to cool completely and add it to a freezer-safe container. The butter chicken will freeze for up to 3 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove-top and prepare your sides.
