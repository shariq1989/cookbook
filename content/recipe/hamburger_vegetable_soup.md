#### Can I freeze Beef and Vegetable Soup?

Yes, this homemade hamburger vegetable soup freezes perfectly! First, allow the soup to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. This soup will freeze for up to 3 months. I suggest making extra and freezing it for an easy meal later on. When youâ€™re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove, and enjoy.
