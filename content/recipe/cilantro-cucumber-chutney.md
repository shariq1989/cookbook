### ABOUT THE SAUCE 

This tasty cucumber, cilantro chutney is a great addition to dishes like biryani and kebabs.

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Full-fat yogurt 

* Serrano Chili: Using chillies is completely optional, but I prefer the heat. If you don't like a lot of spice I suggest using a jalapeno or leaving it out all together. 

* Cilantro 

* Spices: I flavor the chutney with cumin and salt. 

* Olive Oil 

* Cucumber: I use Persian or baby cucumbers because they tend to be crispier, and we usually have them on hand. You can use regular cucumbers if you prefer. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe? 

* A small bowl
* A [food processor](https://amzn.to/3uclbmi) or [blender](https://amzn.to/3zECHk1)

#### How do I store the leftovers? 

Store the leftover chutney in an air-tight container and it will keep the fridge for up to two weeks.
