Servings: 10-12 <!--more-->

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 Box of Mac and Cheese, cooked and chilled
* 2 cups Panko Mix 
* 1/2 tsp Garlic Powder 
* 1/4 tsp Cayenne Powder
* 2 Eggs
* 6 cups Canola Oil 

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Make the boxed macaroni and cheese and refrigerate until chilled.
2. Scoop about 2 tablespoons of macaroni and cheese and shape into 2-inch balls.
3. On a plate, mix together the panko, garlic power, and cayenne powder evenly. 
4. In a small bowl, whisk the eggs until smooth. 
5. Dip the balls into the egg mixture and roll in the panko, creating a solid crust. Repeat until you have about 10-12 balls.
6. Prepare a wire rack over a rimmed baking sheet covered with aluminium foil. 
7. Heat the oil in a pot until the oil registers 350 degrees. Fry 6 cheese balls at a time for about 3 minutes each or until golden. Move to the wire rack to drain and cool before serving.
