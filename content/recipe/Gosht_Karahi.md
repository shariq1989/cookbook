Servings: 3-4 <!--more-->

#### INGREDIENTS 
* 1/2 cup [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW), divided
* 1 1/2 lb Goat, bone- in, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 1 medium Yellow Onion, sliced
* 3 latge Tomatoes, pureed 
* 2 tsp Ginger Paste
* 2 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 1/2 Package Laziza [Karahi Masala](https://amzn.to/2MYzcmx), this makes for a mild spice. 
* 1 tsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC) 
* 1 tsp [Kolongi Seeds](https://amzn.to/3jMZUuh) 
* 2 Green Chilis, split lengthwise
* 1 cup Cilantro, chopped, divided, for garnish 
* 1/4 cup Fresh Ginger, cut into batons, for garnish

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a heavy-bottomed pan, warm the ghee (1/4 cup) over medium-low heat.
2. Add onion, stirring frequently, until they become soft and brown (not burned or charred). This step can take some time, thatâ€™s okay. You are building flavor for the dish. 
3. While the onion is cooking, add the tomatoes to a food processer and blend until smooth. Set aside.
4. Raise the heat to medium-high, add the remaining ghee (1/4 cup), and stir in the goat pieces. Fry the meat, stirring constantly, until the color begins to change.
5. Add the ginger paste and garlic, stirring constantly so nothing burns, about 2 minutes.
6. Next, stir in the pureed tomato, Karahi masala, Kashmiri chili powder, kalonji seeds, 1/3 cup cilantro, and green chilis. Cover the pan and lower the heat to maintain a simmer. 
7. Let the karahi cook for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally to ensure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan. At the 1 hour mark, check the goat for tenderness by attempting to separate the meat from the bone using a fork. The meat should easily pull. If not, allow the meat to simmer until it reaches the desired tenderness.
8. Garnish with ginger batons, cilantro, and extra green chilis, to taste.
9. Serve with naan or long-grain basmati rice.

#### THE STORY BEHIND THE MEAL 

Before meeting Shariq, I (Tressa) had no experience with eating or making Desi food. If you asked me the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry I couldn't have told you. I am incredibly honored to be able to study Desi cooking under my mother-in-law, who is a phenomenal cook. She cooks off-script so you have to observe as she buzzes through the kitchen or you miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build upon flavors to create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by her cooking, though I am sure hers would be even tastier.
