Preparation Time: 10 minutes

Cooking Time: 1 hour 20 minutes

Cuisine: American

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 lb Ground Beef, Lean 
* 4 Garlic Cloves, minced 
* ½ large Yellow Onion, diced 
* Salt and Pepper
* 1 tbsp Basil, dried
* 1 tsp Chili Flakes, dried 
* 2 cups [Pasta Sauce](https://amzn.to/3ve8gQM)
* 4 medium Zucchini, sliced length-wise 
* 1 container Cottage Cheese, drained
* 1 Egg 
* 1 Container fresh Mozzarella Cheese 
* Optional- Fresh Basil, for garnish

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Slice zucchinis length-wise and microwave in a dish for 3 minutes. Drain the excess fluid. 
2. Lightly salt the strips and lay them on a cloth to dry. 
3. In a large skillet, add the beef and cook over medium heat; break it up with a [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/3bI9ZGm). Before the meat is fully cooked, add the onions and garlic. Simmer the mixture until all the meat has browned, about 8-10 minutes. Drain any excess fluid from the pan.  
4. Season with dried basil, chili flakes, salt, and pepper, and then add the pasta sauce. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning to your preference. Let the mixture cook and combine thoroughly with the meat for about 5 minutes. Set aside.   
5. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 
6. In a small bowl, mix the cottage cheese and an egg, then prepare a 9x13 casserole dish with oil. 
7. Blot dry the zucchini strips and layer them in the dish. Add a thin layer of the cheese mixture, followed by the meat mixture, and top with mozzarella cheese. Repeat this process until all the ingredients are gone. The mozzarella should be on top. 
8. Finish with lightly sprinkled parmesan cheese and season with dried basil. Cover the casserole dish with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes. 
9. Drain some excess fluid and bake, uncovered for 15 minutes. 
10. Let the lasagna cool before serving. 

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Lean Ground Beef: Moisture is an issue with zucchini lasagna since the zucchinis release a lot of moisture. Lean ground beef has less fat and releases less moisture as a result. 

* Zucchini: Since moisture can be an issue because of the zucchinis, follow the instructions for preparing the zucchinis. If not, you will end up with zucchini soup. I only know this because I have done it. Don't get me wrong, the soup was delicious, but it wasn't really what we were going for that night. 

* Pasta Sauce: Use your favorite pasta sauce, but only 2 cups of it. Again, you don't want the lasagna to wind up watery. We prefer to use [Rao's](https://amzn.to/30I67Pj) because it is tasty and lower in carbohydrates. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A microwave-safe dish 
* A large skillet 
* A [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/3bI9ZGm)
* A small bowl 
* A 9x13 casserole dish

#### Can I freeze the zuchinni lasagna?

You sure can. First, allow the dish to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container. The zucchini lasagna can freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, bake it uncovered in the oven at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.
