### ABOUT THE MEAL

Serrano crema is my take on the authentic, spicy Peruvian green sauce called Aji Verde; you know what I am talking about, the bright green sauce served alongside roasted chicken in Peruvian restaurants. 

#### Serrano Crema Ingredients: 

* Serrano Chili: I love serrano chillies, but it creates a spicy serrano crema that may be too hot for some. If you want a more mild sauce, I suggest using jalapenos instead.

* Cilantro 

* Garlic 

* Yogurt

* Sour Cream 

* Lime Juice 

* Olive Oil

* Kosher Salt 

* Black Pepper 

#### What do I serve serrano crema with?

* [Peruvian Roasted Chicken] 
* [Tandoori Chicken] 
* Burgers 
* Tacos 
* A topping for salad. 

#### What changes could I make to the crema? 

* For a creamier sauce, add avocados to make it avocado serrano crema.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [food processor](https://amzn.to/3vE4gs7) or [blender](https://amzn.to/2RqFDQM) 

#### Is serrano crema spicy? 

It can be, and it's so tasty. I realize serrano chillies may be too hot for some. If you're looking for a milder sauce, use jalapeno chillies instead, and be sure to remove the stem and all of the seeds.
