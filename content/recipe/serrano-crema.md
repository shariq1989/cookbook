description = "Serrano crema is my take on the authentic, spicy Peruvian green sauce called Aji Verde. You know the one I am talking about; it's the bright green sauce served alongside the roasted chicken in Peruvian restaurants, and it is absolutely incredible. This serrano crema recipe is made using fresh serrano chilis, cilantro, garlic, full-fat yogurt, sour cream, lime juice, and olive oil. It can easily be made in a food processor or blender. Serrano crema pairs well with Peruvian Roasted Chicken and Tandoori Chicken, and it is a tasty topping for burgers, tacos, salad, channa masala, and chaat masala. Is serrano crema spicy? It can be, and it's so tasty. I realize serrano chilies may be too hot for some. If you're looking for a milder sauce, use jalapeno chilies instead, and be sure to remove the stem and all of the seeds. I hope you enjoy this delicious sauce our family loves."

### ABOUT THE MEAL

Serrano crema is my take on the authentic and spicy Peruvian green sauce called Aji Verde. You know the one I am talking about; it's the bright green sauce served alongside the roasted chicken in Peruvian restaurants, and it is absolutely incredible. I hope you enjoy this delicious sauce our family loves. 

#### #### What ingredients are needed for this meal? 

* Serrano Chili: I love serrano chilies, though they create a spicy serrano crema that may be too hot for some. If you want a more mild sauce, I suggest using jalapenos instead. Remove the membrane and seeds before dicing; this lowers the spice level as well. 

* Cilantro 

* Garlic

* Yogurt

* Sour Cream 

* Lime Juice: I use fresh lime juice, about one whole lime. 

* Olive Oil

* Kosher Salt 

* Black Pepper 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [food processor](https://amzn.to/3vE4gs7) or [blender](https://amzn.to/2RqFDQM) 

#### What goes well with serrano crema?

* Serrano crema perfectly pairs with our [Peruvian Roasted Chicken]({{< ref "peruvian-chicken" >}}). 
* Though it's unlike traditional raita, serrano crema goes well with[Tandoori Chicken]({{< ref "tandoori-chicken" >}}). 
* Build a burger with cheese, avocado, thinly sliced serrano chilies, bacon, and then top it with serrano crema.  
* Pour serrano crema on street tacos, fish tacos, [Beef Taco]({{< ref "beef-taco" >}}/), shrimp tacos in place of salsa. 
* Top a salad or chickpea dishes like [Channa Masala](https://www.{{< ref "mango-salsa" >}}/chana-masala/) or chaat masala with serrano crema.  

#### Is serrano crema spicy? 

It can be, and it's so tasty. I realize serrano chilies may be too hot for some. If you're looking for a milder sauce, use jalapeno chilies instead, and be sure to remove the stem and all of the seeds.
