### ABOUT THE MEAL

I made this serrano chili crema as a side for our [Peruvian Chicken](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/peruvian_chicken/). However, I quickly realized it pairs well with other roasted chicken recipes as well. It makes for a delicious spicy salad dressing and can even act as a nice serrano sauce for tacos and chickpea entrees like [Channa Masala](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/chana_masala/).

#### Serrano Crema Ingredients: 

* Serrano Chili: I love the taste of serrano chillies, but the use of this chili creates a spicy serrano crema that may be too hot for some. If you're looking for a milder sauce, use jalapeno for more traditional crema instead. 

* Cilantro 

* Garlic 

* Yogurt

* Sour Cream 

* Lime Juice 

* Olive Oil

* Kosher Salt 

* Black Pepper 

#### What other ingredients could I add to the crema? 

For a creamier sauce, add avocados to make it an avocado serrano crema.  

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [food processor](https://amzn.to/3vE4gs7) or [blender](https://amzn.to/2RqFDQM) 

#### Is serrano crema spicy? 

It can be, and it's so tasty. I realize serrano chillies may be too hot for some. If you're looking for a milder sauce, use jalapeno chillies instead, and be sure to remove the stem and all of the seeds.
