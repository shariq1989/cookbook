### About the Meal 

We love get-togethers with family and friends, and this tandoori chicken recipe or tikka is a perfect addition to any cookout, picnic, or backyard gathering. My recipe will teach you how to make tandoori chicken at home in two easy ways: grilled tandoori chicken or baked tandoori chicken, whichever you prefer. Enjoy this recipe our family loves.

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Chicken: I use chicken drumsticks and thighs. 

* Tandoori Chicken Masala: I enjoy the marinade in this recipe, but you can also use a store-bought [tandoori masala](https://amzn.to/3BrMAT0); be sure to add yogurt, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic paste, ginger paste, and onion to flavor the marinade and tenderize the chicken. 

* Yogurt 

* Lemon 

* Red Food Powder: Red food powder does not alter the taste of the chicken, but it lends the beautiful red color you expect from tandoori chicken. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [blender](https://amzn.to/3GwEcFS) or [food processor](https://amzn.to/3Cs5k6e)
* A large bowl 
* 1-2 [rimmed bakings sheets](https://amzn.to/3mmhAjd)
* A [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3mp5wxK)
* A [Food Thermometer](https://amzn.to/3wGlMxX) 

#### What do I serve with tandoori chicken? 

* Naan
* Long-grained basmati rice 
* Fresh salad 
* Pulao 

#### Can I freeze tandoori chicken?

You sure can. First, allow the chicken to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. The chicken will freeze for up to 4 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm the chicken in the oven or microwave.
