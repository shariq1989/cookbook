#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 lb Ground Beef, Lean 
* 4 Garlic Cloves, minced 
* ½ large Yellow Onion, diced 
* Salt and Pepper
* 1 tbsp Basil, dried
* 1 tsp Chili Flakes, dried 
* 1 1/2 cup [Pasta Sauce](https://amzn.to/3ve8gQM)

#### INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Slice zucchinis length-wise and microwave in a dish for 3 minutes. Drain the excess fluid. 
2. Lightly salt the strips and lay them on a cloth to dry. 
3. In a large skillet, add the beef and cook over medium heat; break it up with a [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/3bI9ZGm). Before the meat is fully cooked, add the onions and garlic. Simmer the mixture until all the meat has browned, about 8-10 minutes. Drain any excess fluid from the pan.

6. In a blender or food processor, mix the cream cheese and egg until smooth, then prepare a 9x13 casserole dish with oil. 
7. Blot dry the zucchini strips and layer them in the dish. Add a thin layer of the cheese mixture, followed by the meat mixture, and top with mozzarella cheese. Repeat this process until all the ingredients are gone. The mozzarella should be on top. 
8. Finish with lightly sprinkled parmesan cheese and season with dried basil. Cover the casserole dish with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes. 
9. Drain some excess fluid and bake, uncovered for 15 minutes. 
10. Let the lasagna cool before serving. 

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

Craving lasagna, but want to skip out on all the carbs or introduce more vegetables? Try this tasty zucchini lasagna. You won't even miss the real thing. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Lean Ground Beef: Moisture is an issue with zucchini lasagna since the zucchinis release a lot of moisture. Lean ground beef has less fat and releases less moisture as a result. 

* Zucchini: Since moisture can be an issue due to the zucchinis, follow my instructions for preparing them. If not, you will end up with zucchini soup. I only know this because I have done it. Don't get me wrong, the soup was delicious, but it wasn't really what we were going for that night. 

* Pasta Sauce: Use your favorite pasta sauce, but only 1 1/2 cup. Again, you don't want watery lasagna. We prefer to use [Rao's](https://amzn.to/30I67Pj) because it is tasty and lower in carbohydrates. 

* Cream Cheese and Egg Mixture: This is the game-changing combination for my zucchini lasagna. It may seem like too much of a departure from authentic lasagna, but trust me on this. 

*  Fresh Mozzarella: The final ingredient is a favorite in our hope. You could use shredded mozzarella, but why do that when you can have the gooey, fresh cheese instead? 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A microwave-safe dish 
* A large skillet 
* A [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/3bI9ZGm)
* A small bowl 
* A 9x13 [casserole dish](https://amzn.to/3bQmY8R)

#### Can I freeze zucchini lasagna?

You sure can. First, allow the dish to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container. The zucchini lasagna can freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, bake it uncovered in the oven at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.
