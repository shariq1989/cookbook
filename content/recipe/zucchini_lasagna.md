### How to Make Zucchini Lasagna 

#### Ingredients  

* 4 medium Zucchini, sliced length-wise 
* Kosher Salt, to taste 
* 1 lb Ground Beef, Lean 
* ½ large Yellow Onion, diced 
* 4 Garlic Cloves, minced 
* 1 tbsp Basil, dried
* 1 tsp Red Chili Flakes, dried 
* Black Pepper, coarse ground, to taste 
* 1 1/2 cup [Pasta Sauce](https://amzn.to/3ve8gQM)
* 1 block Creamed Cheese
* 1 Egg 
* 1 container Ovaline Mozzarella, 4 oz, sliced 
* 1/4 cup Parmesan Cheese, to garnish  
* Fresh Basil, julienne, to garnish

#### Instructions  

1. Slice zucchinis length-wise and microwave them in a microwave-safe [dish](https://amzn.to/3peWaoc) for 3 minutes. Drain the excess fluid. 
2. Lightly salt the strips and lay them on a cloth to dry. 
3. In a [skillet](https://amzn.to/3EgxSAM), add the beef and cook over medium heat; break it up using a [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/3bI9ZGm). Next, add the onions and garlic. Simmer the mixture until all the meat has browned, about 8-10 minutes. Drain any excess fluid from the pan.  
4. Season with dried basil, red chili flakes, salt, and pepper, and then add the pasta sauce. Taste the sauce, and adjust the seasoning. Let the mixture cook and combine thoroughly with the meat for about 5 minutes. Set aside.   
5. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 
6. In a [blender](https://amzn.to/3DbmcOp) or [food processor](https://amzn.to/3dj7wSx), combine the cream cheese and egg until smooth, then prepare a [casserole dish](https://amzn.to/3bQmY8R) with oil. 
7. Blot dry the zucchini strips and layer them in the [dish](https://amzn.to/3bQmY8R). Add a thin layer of the cheese mixture over the top, followed by the meat mixture, and then the mozzarella cheese. Repeat this process until all the ingredients are gone. Finish with a top layer of mozzarella cheese and lightly sprinkled parmesan cheese.
8. Season the lasagna with dried basil and pepper. Cover the casserole dish with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes. 
9. Drain some excess fluid and bake uncovered for another 15 minutes. Let the lasagna cool before serving.

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

Zucchini lasagna is a fresh take on classic comfort food. It’s loaded with veggies, but still has all the rich flavor and texture of a traditional lasagna. This is the perfect easy, weeknight meal for the whole family to enjoy. Zucchini Lasagna is low fat, gluten-free, low-carb, and keto-friendly. I hope you enjoy this tasty zucchini lasagna our family loves. 

#### What ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Zucchini: Since moisture can be an issue due to the zucchinis, follow my instructions for preparing them. If not, you will end up with zucchini soup. I only know this because I have done it. Don't get me wrong, the soup was delicious, but it wasn't really what we were going for that night. 

* Kosher Salt

* Lean Ground Beef: Moisture is an issue with zucchini lasagna since the zucchinis release a lot of moisture. Lean ground beef has less fat and releases less moisture as a result. 

* Yellow Onion

* Garlic 

* Dried and Fresh Basil 

* Red Chili Flakes

* Black Pepper

* [Pasta Sauce](https://amzn.to/3ve8gQM): Use your favorite pasta sauce, but only 1 1/2 cup. Again, you don't want watery lasagna. We prefer [Rao's](https://amzn.to/30I67Pj) because it's tasty and low in carbohydrates. 

* Cream Cheese and Egg: This is the game-changing combination for any zucchini lasagna. It may seem like too much of a departure from authentic lasagna, but trust me on this. It's delicious.  

* Ovaline Mozzarella 

* Parmesan Cheese
