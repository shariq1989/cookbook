### How to Make Low Carb Biscuits and Gravy: 

#### Ingredients 

For the Biscuits: 

* 2 1/3 cups [Almond Flour](https://amzn.to/2POPsYC)
* 2 tsp Baking Powder
* 1/2 tsp Kosher Salt
* 2 Eggs
* 6 tbsp Butter, melted, divided  
* 1/4 cup Sour Cream 
 
For the Gravy: 

* 1 lb Ground Breakfast Sausage 
* 2 tbsp Butter
* 1 cup Heavy cream
* 1 cup Water
* 1 1/2 tbsp Pepper, coarse ground
* 1/2 tsp Kosher Salt
* 1 tsp Garlic Powder
* 1 tsp Corn Starch
* Black Pepper, coarse ground

#### Instructions

For the Biscuits: 

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and line a [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3ul9KrC) with parchment paper. Set aside
2. Crack the eggs into a small bowl and whisk them together. Set aside. 
3. In a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3E1f1cS), add the almond flour, baking powder, garlic powder, and salt. Then, stir in the reserved egg mixture, 5 tbsp melted butter, and the sour cream.
4. Using an ice cream scoop or similar-sized spoon, scoop out the dough. Use your hands to form a rounded biscuit shape and then sightly flatten the top with your fingers and place them on the [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3ul9KrC). Repeat with the remaining dough. 
5. Glaze the top of the biscuits with the melted butter. 
6. Bake for 15 minutes, until the biscuits are firm and golden. 

For the Gravy: 

1. While the biscuits are baking, brown the sausage in a [saute pan](https://amzn.to/2ZzNJLG) over medium heat for 4-5 minutes. Remove the sausage from the pan using a slotted spoon and set it aside. 
2. Return the pan to medium heat and add the heavy cream, water, pepper, salt, and garlic powder. Then, gently whisk in the corn starch. 
3. Bring the mixture to a gentle bubble, stirring occasionally to thicken the gravy. Reduce heat to low and then return the meat to the pan. Stir to combine, cover, and simmer for another 5 minutes. 
4. Taste and season with black pepper to serve.

### About the Biscuits and Gravy

My mama was a server in a mom-and-pop diner in Arizona for as long as I can remember. One thing the diner did well is biscuits and gravy. I often crave biscuits and gravy, maybe more for the memory than the meal itself, but I always struggle with the carb load of regular biscuits and gravy. This dilemma became the starting point for this delicious breakfast recipe you see today. My biscuit and gravy recipe is easy to make and low carb, if that's your thing. The biscuits are buttery and flaky and served with creamy sausage gravy, just like those you would eat in your favorite diner or grandma's house. Make them to serve or double the recipe to have some to freeze for later. I hope you enjoy this biscuit and gravy recipe our family loves.

#### Can I freeze biscuits and gravy?

Yes, but do so separately. This is one of my favorite things about making this recipe. I often double the recipe for the biscuits to freeze them, so we have quick and easy breakfast, or dinner rolls the next time around. Allow the biscuits to cool completely, and add them to a freezer-safe bag. Do the same with any leftover gravy. The biscuits and the gravy will freeze for up to 3 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, warm the biscuits in the oven or microwave, and then warm the gravy on the stovetop. Enjoy!
