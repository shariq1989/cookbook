### ABOUT THE MEAL

Karahi is a Pakistani dish that gets its name from the wok-like pan it is made in. The traditional karahi was cooked over an open flame, low and slow, but the true beauty of a good karahi is in its rich tomato base and fragrant toppings like cilantro, ginger, and green chillies. There are so many variations of karahi, so I hope you enjoy this quick and simple chicken karahi or chicken kadai recipe our family loves. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken: I use bone-in chicken legs and thighs most often using this recipe. If you prefer boneless chicken karahi, use chicken thighs. Be sure to adjust the cooking time accordingly; the safe temperature for the chicken is 160 degrees.  

* Tomatoes: Tomatoes are the base for the rich, flavorful gravy. I use Roma tomatoes because they tend to have less moisture. 

* Onions: Onions are not traditionally included in karahi, but I prefer the result with onion added. 

* Ginger and Garlic 

* Karahi Masala: I use Laziza Karahi Masala; I have tried others, but I always return to this one. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A heavy-bottomed pan or [karahi](https://amzn.to/3BuoEPL)

#### Can I make chicken karahi spicy? Can I lower the spice? 

This recipe is for a mild chicken karahi. If you prefer a more spicy dish, use 3/4 of the Laziza Karahi Masala. If you feel this will be too spicy for you, I suggest using 1/4 of the package. 

#### Can I freeze Chicken Karahi?

You sure can. First, allow the chicken karahi to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. Karahi will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your sides.

#### What other types of karahi are there? 

* Balochi Karahi 
* Charsi Karahi: This isn't necessarily a type of karahi, but it's a famous rendition hailing from a restaurant in Peshawar, Pakistan. 
* Green Karahi 
* Karahi Dhaba-Style
* Lahori Karahi 
* Punjabi Karahi 
* Shashlik Karahi 
* White Karahi
