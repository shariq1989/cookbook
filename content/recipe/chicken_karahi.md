### HOW TO MAKE CHICKEN KARAHI 

#### CHICKEN KARAHI INGREDIENTS 

* 2 tbsp [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW)
* 1 1/2 lb Chicken Thighs and legs, trimmed
* 1 medium Purple Onion, thinly sliced
* 3 large Tomatoes, pureed 
* 2 tsp Ginger Paste
* 3 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 1/2 Package Karahi Masala 
* 1 tsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC) 
* 2 Thai Green Chilis, split lengthwise
* 1/2 cup Cilantro, chopped, for garnish

#### INSTRUCTIONS 

1. In a heavy-bottomed pan or [Karahi](https://amzn.to/3BuoEPL), warm ghee over medium-low heat.
2. Add the onion and cook until they become brown and caramelized. This step can take some time; that’s okay. You are building flavor for the dish.

5. Add the tomatoes and lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer for 5 minutes.
6. Next, add the chicken and cook for 20 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally. 
7. Garnish with ginger batons, cilantro, and extra green chilis. Serve with naan or long-grain basmati rice.

### ABOUT THE MEAL

Enjoy this simple Chicken Karahi or chicken Kadai recipe. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken: I use bone-in chicken legs and thighs. If you prefer boneless chicken Karahi, use chicken thighs.  Be sure to adjust the cooking time accordingly; the safe temperature for the chicken is 160 degrees.  

* Tomatoes 

* Onions 

* Ginger and Garlic 

* Karahi Masala: I use Laziza Karahi Masala; I have tried others, but I always return to this one. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A heavy-bottomed pan or [Karahi](https://amzn.to/3BuoEPL)

#### Can I make Chicken Karahi Spicy? Can I lower the spice? 

This recipe is for a mild chicken karahi. If you prefer a more spicy dish, use 3/4 of the Laziza Karahi Masala. If you feel this will be too spicy for you, I suggest using 1/4 of the package. 

#### Can I freeze Chicken Karahi?

You sure can. First, allow the Chicken Karahi to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. Karahi will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your sides.

#### What other types of Karahi are there? 

* Charsi Karahi: This isn't necessarily a type of karahi, but it's a famous rendition hailing from a restaurant in Peshawar, Pakistan. 
* White Karahi 
* Balochi Karahi 
* Lahori Karahi 
* Green Karahi 
* Punjabi Karahi 
* Shashlik Karahi
