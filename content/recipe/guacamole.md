### ABOUT THE SIDE 

For a super easy guacamole on the go, all you really need is a few ripe avocados and a little salt; everything else is extra, but oh so tasty. Enjoy this fresh guacamole recipe our whole family loves. 

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Avocado: You will want to use large avocados for this recipe- the riper, the better. If you cannot find large avocados, use 4-5 smaller ones. Check for ripeness by gently pressing the outside of the avocado. If there is no give, the avocado is not ripe. If there is just a little give, the avocado is ripe. If there is too much give, the avocado may be past ripe. 

* Red Onion: I prefer the strong flavor of red onion in my guacamole. If red onions are too strong for you, rinse the chopped onion under water and pat them dry before mixing them into the guacamole. 

* Cilantro 

* Jalapenos: I use finely diced jalapenos most of the time. If I crave spicier guacamole, I will use a serrano pepper instead. 

* Garlic Cloves 

* Lime Juice 

* Tomatoes: Tomatoes are usually a key ingredient in guacamole. However, Shariq hates raw tomatoes, so we skip them. If you enjoy tomatoes, I suggest finely dicing one Roma tomato and folding it into the guacamole at the end. 

* Kosher Salt 

* Cumin 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A small bowl 
* A [food processor](https://amzn.to/3lamLSe), if you prefer 

#### Is guacamole vegetarian? Is this guacamole vegan?

#### How should I store guacamole?

This guacamole keeps well in the fridge if stored properly. To do so, add the guacamole to an airtight container. I leave the pit in the guacamole and place plastic wrap on top; next, I press down so that the plastic covers any exposed guacamole. Cover the dish with the lid; it will keep up to 3-5 days.
