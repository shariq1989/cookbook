### ABOUT THE SIDE 

The only thing you need to make guacamole is a few ripe avocados and a little bit of salt; everything else is extra but oh so tasty. This recipe is how our family likes to prepare it. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Avocado: You will want to use large avocados for this recipe- the riper, the better. If you cannot find large avocadoes, use 4-5 smaller ones. Check for ripeness by gently pressing the outside of the avocado. If there is no give, the avocado is not ripe. If there is just a little give, the avocado is ripe. If there is too much give, the avocado may be past ripe. 

* Red Onion: I prefer the strong taste of red onion in my guacamole. If red onions are too strong for you, rinse the chopped onion under water and pat them dry before mixing them into the guacamole. 

* Limes: There is a notable difference between fresh lime juice and bottled. I prioritize fresh ingredients whenever possible. 

* Jalapenos: I use finely diced jalapenos most of the time, but if I am craving something spicier, I reach for a serrano pepper. 

* Tomatoes: Tomatoes are usually a key ingredient in guacamole. However, Shariq hates raw tomatoes, so we skip over them. If you are one to enjoy tomatoes, I suggest using Roma.

#### How should I store guacamole?

This guacamole keeps well in the refrigerator if stored properly. Add the guacamole to an airtight container. I leave the pit in the guacamole and place Saran wrap on top, press down so that the plastic covers any exposed guacamole. Cover the dish with the lid; it will keep up to 3-5 days.
