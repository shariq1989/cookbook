### ABOUT THE SIDE 

The only thing you absolutely need to make guacamole is a few ripe avocados and a little bit of salt; everything else is extra but oh so tasty. This is how our family likes to prepare it. 

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Avocado: You will want to use large avocados for this recipe- the riper, the better. If you cannot find large avocadoes, then use 4-5 smaller ones. You can check for ripeness by gently pressing the outside of the avocado. If there is no give, the avocado is not ripe. If there is just a little give, the avocado is ripe. If there is too much give, the avocado may be past ripe. 

* Red Onion: I prefer the strong taste of red onion in my guacamole. If red onions are too strong for you, rinse the chopped onion under water and pat them dry before adding them in. 

* Limes: There is a notable difference between fresh lime juice and bottled. I prioritize fresh whenever possible. 

* Jalapeno Peppers: I use finely diced jalapenos most of the time, but if I am craving something spicier, I reach for a serrano pepper. 

* Tomatoes: Tomatoes are usually a key ingredient in guacamole. However, Shariq looks at uncooked tomatoes with disdain, so we skip over them. If you are one to enjoy tomatoes, I suggest using Roma.

#### How should I store my guacamole?

This guacamole keeps well in the refrigerator if stored properly. Add the guacamole to an airtight container. I leave the pit in the guacamole and squeeze a little bit of fresh lime juice over the top to preserve the freshness. Place Saran wrap on top of the guacamole and press it down, so the plastic covers any exposed guacamole. Cover the container with the lid; it will keep up to 3-5 days.
