### How to Make Crispy Sesame Tofu 

#### Ingredients  

For the Coconut - Chili Dressing:

* ¼ cup Unsweetened Coconut Milk
* 1 Lime, zest, and juice
* 2 tbsp [Chili Garlic Sauce](https://amzn.to/2TeZd41) 
* 1 tsp [Chili Oil](https://amzn.to/2XR3Bbu)   
* 1 tsp Brown Sugar
* ¼ cup Sesame Oil, toasted 

For the Tofu:

* 1 Package Extra-Firm Tofu, cut into rectangles 
* ½ cup Panko 
* 1/3 cup White Sesame Seeds 
* 1 tbsp Black Sesame Seeds 
* ½ tsp Black Pepper
* 1/2 tsp Red Chili Flakes
* 2 tbsp [Tapioca Flour](https://amzn.to/3hKs9tS)
* ¼ cup Vegetable Oil for pan-frying

#### Instructions  

For the Dressing: 

1. In a small bowl, whisk the coconut milk, lime zest, chili paste, chili oil, and brown sugar until sugar dissolves completely. Slowly pour in the sesame oil and whisk until the dressing becomes creamy. Set aside. 

For the Tofu: 

1. Pat dry the tofu with a towel and cut it into large rectangles. Season lightly with salt and set aside. 
2. In a small bowl, add the panko, white and black sesame seeds, black pepper, and chili flakes. Pour this mixture into a [skillet](https://amzn.to/3FXg6CK) with 1 tsp of sesame oil. Toast the mixture for 2-4 minutes. Set aside.
3. Whisk the tapioca flour and water together in another small bowl. 
4. Dredge the tofu slices, one at a time, into the tapioca mixture; coat well. Then, dip the tofu into the bowl with the panko mixture. Be sure to coat the tofu well on all sides, then move to a [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3rbDczw). Repeat with the remaining tofu slices.

For the Frying: 

1. Set a [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3rbDczw) into the [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3hI9bV5).
2. Heat 1/4 cup oil in a [skillet](https://amzn.to/3FXg6CK) over medium-low heat. 
3. Test the oil by frying one tofu slice, adjust the heat accordingly. 
4. Then small batches, pan-fry the tofu until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Then, transfer the tofu slices to the [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3hI9bV5). Repeat with the remaining tofu. 
5. Allow the tofu slices to cool on the [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3rbDczw). 
6. To garnish, drizzle with the coconut chili dressing and serve with jasmine rice, broccoli, or steamed mixed vegetables as we did.

### About the Tofu

If you like tofu, enjoy this nutty and sweet tofu created by Nik Sharma. This vegan, black and white sesame-crusted tofu is the perfect blend of sweet and savory. I cook the tofu in a frying pan, but it could also be baked in an oven or air fryer if you prefer.

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Unsweetened Coconut Milk 

* Lime Zest 

* [Chili Garlic Sauce](https://amzn.to/2TeZd41) 

* [Chili Oil](https://amzn.to/2XR3Bbu)

* Brown Sugar 

* Sesame: I firmly believe tofu and sesame are a perfect pair. For that reason, I included two types of sesame seeds and used sesame oil in the dressing.

* Extra-Firm Tofu: Extra-firm tofu holds up well during the frying process, resulting in crispy and flavorful tofu. 

* Panko: I used panko for this recipe to create the crust for the tofu. 

* Black Pepper 

* Red Chili Flakes 

* [Tapioca Flour](https://amzn.to/3hKs9tS)

* Vegetable Oil 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* 3 small bowls 
* 2 [skillet](https://amzn.to/3FXg6CK)
* A [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3hI9bV5)
* A [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3rbDczw)
* A [cast-iron skillet](https://amzn.to/3BbJZ0D) or [stainless-steel skillet](https://amzn.to/3xJ7oEN)

#### Can I bake the tofu instead? 

I prefer pan-frying the tofu for this recipe, but it can be easy and more time-efficient to bake it instead. When baking, line the tofu on a [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3hI9bV5). Preheat the oven at 400 degrees and bake for 25-30 minutes until they've reached desired crispness. 

#### Can I make it crispy tofu the air-fryer? 

You will need to work in batches. Arrange the tofu in a single layer in the [air fryer](https://amzn.to/3IbYKEn) basket, and cook at 400 degrees for about 5 minutes. Flip the tofu pieces, and then cook for another 5 minutes. Repeat this process until all the tofu has had an opportunity to be cooked.

#### Is sesame tofu vegetarian? Is it vegan?

This recipe is both vegetarian and vegan-friendly.

#### How can I store the leftovers? 

I don't recommend freezing the tofu after being cooked, but you can easily store the leftovers in a covered container in your fridge. The tofu will keep for 3-4 days. When you're ready to eat, re-warm them in the microwave for 1-2 minutes.
