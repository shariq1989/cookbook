#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1⅓ cup [Almond Flour](https://amzn.to/3F38Qpi), blanched

* ¼ cup Unsweetened Almond Milk
* 2 Large Eggs

1. In a large bowl, mix the dry ingredients. Set aside. 
2. In a small bowl, whisk the almond milk, eggs, and vanilla.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the large bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir to combine. 
4. Heat a [non-stick skillet](https://amzn.to/3xy2Mkd) or [griddle](https://amzn.to/3vFthD9) over medium-low heat. Once the surface is warm, use a ¼ measuring cup to pour the batter onto the pan. Cook the pancakes for 1-2 minutes per side, adjusting the heat so that the middle cooks without burning the outside. Quick note, almond flour pancakes tend to darken a bit faster. 
5. Once once side is cooked through and flipped, give it a light tap with your spatula to spread out the mixture since these pancakes will be slightly smaller than regular  pancakes. 
6. Serve these pancakes with butter, maple syrup, or topping of your choice.

### ABOUT THE PANCAKES

These almond flour pancakes have saved me so much time and preparation. Before this, I would make pancakes for my children and a separate batter for myself. Since I switched to this recipe for the whole family, my children did not notice the difference. And because the main ingredient for the pancakes is almond flour, they keep you and your family full much longer. This particular recipe serves two to three people. I usually double or triple the recipe and freeze them to enjoy as a quick breakfast in the future. Enjoy these fluffy almond flour pancakes our family loves.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* [Almond Flour](https://amzn.to/3F38Qpi): For best results and fluffy pancakes, I recommend using blanched almond flour.

* Eggs: Eggs add texture and act as a binder.  

* Baking Powder

* Almond Milk: Adding to the overall nuttiness, almond milk also provides needed moisture for the pancakes. 

* Vanilla Extract

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large bowl 
* A small bowl 
* A [non-stick skillet](https://amzn.to/3xy2Mkd) or [griddle](https://amzn.to/3vFthD9) 

#### What do I do if the batter isn't coming out right? 

If it looks as though the batter is coming out too thick, add more almond milk until it reaches desired consistency. If the batter is too thin, sprinkle more almond flour. 

#### Can I make almond flour pancakes vegan? 

Of course. To make almond flour pancakes with no eggs, simply use flax seed, chia seeds, or a combination of the two. Be sure to use 1 part water and two parts seed. Next, mix the two together and let it sit until the mixure congeals before adding it to the batter. The result will be a tasty, eggless almond flour pancake. 

#### Can I freeze almond flour pancakes?

Yes, first allow the pancakes to cool completely, and then add them to a freezer-safe container or bag. Pancakes will freeze for 3 months, but I doubt you can wait that long. When you’re ready to eat, remove the pancakes from the freezer. Some of the pancakes may have stuck together. Usually, I can pry them apart and warm them in the microwave for a quick breakfast. You could also reheat them in the oven at 350 degrees.
