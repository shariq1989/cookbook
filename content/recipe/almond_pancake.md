### ABOUT THE MEAL

These almond flour pancakes have saved me so much time and preparation. Before this recipe, I would make pancakes for my children and mix a separate batter for myself. Since I switched to this recipe for the whole family, my children did not notice the difference between these and the pancakes I usually serve them. And because the main ingredient for the pancakes is almond flour, they will keep you and your family more full for much longer. 

This particular recipe serves about two to four people. I usually make them in bulk and freeze them to enjoy as a quick breakfast in the future. 

A quick note on your batter, if it looks as though it is coming out too thick, add more almond milk until it reaches desired consistency. If the batter is too thin, sprinkle a bit more almond flour. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Almond Flour: For best results and fluffy pancakes, I suggest using blanched almond flour.

* Eggs: Eggs add texture to the pancakes, but they also act as a binder.  

* Baking Powder: I use baking powder to add a bit more fluff to the pancakes.  

* Almond Milk: Adding to the overall nuttiness of the pancakes, the almond milk also provides needed moisture to the mixture.  

* Vanilla Extract

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large bowl 
* A small bowl 
* A [non-stick skillet](https://amzn.to/3xy2Mkd) or [griddle](https://amzn.to/3vFthD9) 

#### Can I freeze almond flour pancakes?

Yes, first allow the pancakes to cool completely and then add them to a freezer-safe container or bag, careful to remove as much air as possible. These pancakes will freeze for months, but I doubt you can wait that long. 

When you’re ready to eat, remove the pancakes from the freezer. Some of the pancakes have stuck together. Usually, I can pry them apart and warm them in the microwave for a quick breakfast. You could also reheat them in the oven at 350 degrees.
