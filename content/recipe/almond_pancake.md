#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1⅓ cup Blanched Almond Flour
* 1 tsp Baking Powder
* ¼ tsp Sea Salt
* ¼ cup Unsweetened Almond Milk

#### INSTRUSTIONS

1. In a large bowl, stir the dry ingredients together. Set aside. 
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the almond milk, eggs, and vanilla.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients and stir until fully combined. 
4. Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium-low heat. Once the surface is warm, use a ¼ measuring cup to pour the batter onto the pan.

### ABOUT THE MEAL

These almond flour pancakes have saved me so much time and preparation. Before this recipe, I would make pancakes for my children and mix a separate batter for myself. Since I switched to this recipe for the whole family, my children did not notice the difference between these and the pancakes I usually serve them. And because the main ingredient for the pancakes is almond flour, they will keep you and your family more full for much longer. 

This particular recipe serves about two to three people. I personally tend to make them in bulk and freeze them to enjoy as a quick breakfast in the future. 

A quick note on your batter, if it looks as though it is coming out thick, go ahead and add more almond milk until it reaches desired consistency. If the batter is too thin, sprinkle a bit more almond flour. 


#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Almond Flour: For best results and fluffy pancakes, I suggest using blanched almond flour.

* Eggs: Eggs add moisture to the pancakes, but also act as a binder for the other ingredients.  

* Baking Powder: I use baking powder to add a bit more fluff to the pancakes.  

* Almond Milk: Continuing with the nutty flavor, almond milk adds moisture to the mixture.  

* Vanilla Extract: For a bit of sweetness.

#### Can I freeze almond flour pancakes?

Yes, first allow the pancakes to cool completely and then add them to a freezer-safe container or bag, careful to remove as much air as possible. These pancakes will freeze for months, but I doubt you can wait that long. 

When you’re ready to eat, remove the pancakes from the freezer. Some of the pancakes have stuck together. Usually, I can pry them apart and warm them in the microwave for a quick breakfast. You could also reheat them in the oven at 350 degrees.
