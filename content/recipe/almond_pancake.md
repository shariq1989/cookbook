Servings: 2-3, 3-inch Pancakes <!--more-->

Preparation Time: 10 minutes 

Cooking Time: 10 minutes 

Cuisine: American 

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1⅓ cup Blanched Almond Flour
* 1 tsp Baking Powder
* ¼ tsp Sea Salt
* 1/2 tsp Cinnamon 
* ¼ cup Unsweetened Almond Milk
* 2 Large Eggs
* 1 tsp Vanilla Extract 
  
#### INSTRUSTIONS

1. In a large bowl, stir the dry ingredients together. Set aside. 
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the almond milk, eggs, and vanilla.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients and stir to combine. 
4. Heat a [non-stick skillet](https://amzn.to/3xy2Mkd) or [griddle](https://amzn.to/3vFthD9) over medium-low heat. Once the surface is warm, use a ¼ measuring cup to pour the batter onto the pan. Cook the pancakes for 1-2 minutes per side, adjusting the heat as needed so the middle cooks without burning the outside. Quick note, almond flour pancakes tend to darken a bit faster. 
5. Once once side is cooked through and flipped, give it a light tap with your spatula to spread out the mixture since these pancakes will be slightly smaller than other pancakes. 
6. Serve the pancakes with butter, maple syrup, or a favorite topping of your choice.

### ABOUT THE MEAL

These almond flour pancakes have saved me so much time and preparation. Before this, I would make pancakes for my children and mix a separate batter for myself. Since I switched to this recipe for the whole family, my children did not even notice the difference. And because the main ingredient for the pancakes is almond flour, they will keep you and your family full for much longer. This particular recipe serves about two to three people. I usually double or triple the recipe and freeze them for a quick breakfast in the future. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Almond Flour: For best results and fluffy pancakes, I suggest using blanched almond flour.

* Eggs: Eggs add texture to the pancakes, but they also act as a binder.  

* Baking Powder

* Almond Milk: Adding to the overall nuttiness of the pancakes, the almond milk also provides needed moisture.  

* Vanilla Extract

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large bowl 
* A small bowl 
* A [non-stick skillet](https://amzn.to/3xy2Mkd) or [griddle](https://amzn.to/3vFthD9) 

#### What do I do if the batter isn't coming out right? 

If it looks as though it is coming out too thick, add more almond milk until it reaches desired consistency. If the batter is too thin, sprinkle a bit more almond flour. 

#### Can I freeze almond flour pancakes?

Yes, first allow the pancakes to cool completely and then add them to a freezer-safe container or bag, careful to remove as much air as possible. These pancakes will freeze for 3 months, but I doubt you can wait that long. When you’re ready to eat, remove the pancakes from the freezer. Some of the pancakes may have stuck together. Usually, I can pry them apart and warm them in the microwave for a quick breakfast. You could also reheat them in the oven at 350 degrees.
