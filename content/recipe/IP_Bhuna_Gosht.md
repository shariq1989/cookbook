#### INGREDIENTS 

For Gosht: 

* 1½ lb Goat, cut into 1-inch pieces (rinse meat before cooking) 
* 2 medium Yellow Onions, thinly sliced
* ¼ cup Garlic Cloves
* 4-inch Fresh Ginger, julienne
* ¾ cup Full-Fat Yogurt 
* 2½ tbsp Coriander Powder 
* 2 tsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC)
* ½ tsp Turmeric Powder
* Salt, to taste
* ⅓ cup [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW), plus 3-4 tbsp Ghee 
* 2 tbsp Cilantro, chopped

For Whole Spices:

* 6 Boriya Chilis, dry 
* 2 Bay Leaves
* 1½ - inch Cinnamon Stick
* 3 Whole Cloves
* 5 Whole Black Peppercorns
* 5 Green Cardamom Pods
* 2 Black Cardamom Pods
* ½ tsp Nutmeg, ground

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. To begin, wash the goat and add it to an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) with 1 cup water and 1 tsp of salt. Cook on high pressure for 40 minutes with a quick release (This cook time is for high-elevation. You can reduce cooking time for lower elevation).
2. Gather the whole spices and stir in the nutmeg, set aside.
3. While meat is cooking, heat ghee (1/3 cup) in a heavy-bottomed pan and add whole spices until they begin to crackle.
4. Add garlic cloves and ginger slices. Saute until golden.
5. Mix in the onions and fry until they are soft and translucent. At this point, you can add the goat once it has finished cooking.
6. Add yogurt and salt and let it cook on high heat until the yogurt leaves water on the sides.
7. Turn down the heat to medium-high and cover the pan. Allow mixture to simmer, about 3-5 minutes.
8. Stir in the coriander powder, turmeric, Kashmiri chili powder, and mix well.
9. Adjust to high heat again and fry until ghee escapes to the sides. Add ghee as needed while frying (up to 4 tbsp).
10, Once the ghee separates, check the salt and adjust if needed.
11. Allow mixture to cook on high, stirring regularly. Slowly the goat will thicken and turn deep brown.
12. Garnish with cilantro and fresh ginger slices and serve with naan or rice. 

#### ABOUT THE MEAL 

Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with Desi food. If you asked me about the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry, I couldn’t have told you, so learning how to cook Indian food is near and dear to my heart. It's been an honor to study Desi cooking under my talented mother-in-law. She prepares food off-script and you have to watch her closely as she buzzes through the kitchen, or you miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build upon flavors and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by what I have learned cooking alongside her.
