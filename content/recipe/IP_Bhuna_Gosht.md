#### INGREDIENTS 

For Gosht: 

* 1½ lb Goat, cut into 1-inch pieces (rinse meat before cooking) 
* 2 medium Yellow Onions, thinly sliced
* ¼ cup Garlic Cloves
* 4-inch Fresh Ginger, julienne
* ¾ cup Full-Fat Yogurt 
* 2½ tbsp Coriander Powder 
* 2 tsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC)
* ½ tsp Turmeric Powder
* Salt, to taste
* ⅓ cup [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW), plus 3-4 tbsp Ghee 
* 2 tbsp Cilantro, chopped

For Whole Spices:

* 6 Boriya Chilis, dry 
* 2 Bay Leaves
* 1½ - inch Cinnamon Stick
* 3 Whole Cloves
* 5 Whole Black Peppercorns
* 5 Green Cardamom Pods
* 2 Black Cardamom Pods
* ½ tsp Nutmeg, ground

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Begin by washing the goat and add it to an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) with 1 cup water and 1 tsp of salt. Cook on manual high pressure for 40 minutes with quick release. This cooking time is for high-elevation. You can reduce cooking time for lower elevation. 
- If you don't have an Instant Pot or pressure cooker, you could also cook the goat in a heavy-bottomed pan for an hour on medium heat and set aside.
2. Gather the whole spices and stir in the nutmeg, set aside.
3. While the meat is cooking, heat the ghee (1/3 cup) in a heavy-bottomed pan and add whole spices and nutmeg until they begin to sputter.
4. Add the garlic and ginger, saute until golden.
5. Next, add the onions and fry until they become translucent and soften. 6. At this point, you can add the goat once it has finished cooking.
7. Mix in the yogurt and salt and let it cook on high heat until the yogurt releases liquid on the sides.
8. Reduce the heat to medium and cover the pan with a lid. Allow mixture to simmer, about 5 minutes.
9. Stir in the coriander powder, turmeric, Kashmiri chili powder, and mix well.
10. Adjust to high heat once again and fry until ghee escapes to the sides. Add ghee as needed while frying (up to 4 tbsp).
11. Once the ghee separates, check the salt and adjust if necessary.
12. Allow the mixture to cook on high, stirring regularly. Slowly the mixture will thicken and turn deep brown.
13. Garnish with cilantro and fresh ginger slices and serve with naan or rice. 

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with Desi food. If you asked me the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry, I couldn’t have told you, so learning how to cook Indian food is near and dear to my heart. It’s been an honor to study Desi cooking under my talented mother-in-law. She prepares food off-script; you have to watch her closely as she buzzes through the kitchen, or you miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build upon flavors and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by what I have learned cooking alongside her.
