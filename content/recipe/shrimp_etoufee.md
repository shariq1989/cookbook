#### INSTRUSTIONS

For the Shrimp Broth: 

1. In a [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3bveYK6), warm oil over medium heat. Add the reserved shrimp shells and allow them to saute for about 3 minutes.
2. Add water and simmer for 5 minutes. 
3. Using a slotted spoon, scoop out the shells and discard. Set the broth aside. 

For the Etoufee: 

1. In a heavy-bottomed saute pan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Then, add the corn starch. Whisk until it begins to foam and a roux forms, about 3 minutes. 
2. Add the onion, celery, green bell pepper, and garlic. Cook until vegetables soften, about 5-7 minutes. 
3. Next, add the Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, and thyme sprigs. Cook until aromatic. 
4. Stir in the reserved shrimp broth and simmer for 30 minutes over medium heat. 
5. Add the shrimp to the broth and cook for 3-5 minutes. Cater the cooking time based on the size of the shrimp you use; be careful not to overcook the shrimp. 
6. Season the etoufee with salt and serve with rice. 

### ABOUT THE MEAL

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Jumbo Shrimp: I used jumbo shrimp in this recipe. You can use other sized shrimp, but be sure to adjust the cooking time accordingly. 
 
* Vegetables: I used traditional vegetables, including onion, celery, and green bell pepper. 

* Herbs: In my humble opinion, herbs can change an entire dish. I use fresh garlic, bay leaves, and fresh thyme to season the etoufee.  

* Shrimp Broth: You can opt for store-bought shrimp broth, but why not use the whole shrimp and make your own? The broth included in this recipe takes less than 10 minutes. 

* Cajun or Creole Seasoning: I prefer to use the Cajun seasoning included in this recipe, but if you purchase seasoning from the store, I suggest [Slap Ya Mama](https://amzn.to/3w73i81).
