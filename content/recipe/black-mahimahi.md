### ABOUT THE MEAL

If you're looking for a healthy seafood meal that doesn't taste too fishy, mahi-mahi is the one for you. The fish is flavored with warm spices and butter to create a tasty, blackened crust- perfected by cooking in the cast-iron skillet over high heat. I garnish my mahi-mahi with fresh [mango salsa]({{< ref "mango-salsa" >}}). I hope you enjoy the best-blackened mahi-mahi recipe our family loves. 

#### What ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Mahi-Mahi: I often use the frozen fish filets from Costco, but you can use fresh fish if you have access to it. Mahi-mahi is versatile and cooks well, but keep in mind; this is a lean fish. Be careful not to overcook it, or it will dry out. 

* Butter 

* Blackened Mahi-mahi Seasonings: Blackening is a technique often used in Cajun cooking to prepare fish and other meat. I use a tasty combination of chili powder, garlic powder, oregano, smoked paprika, salt, cumin, black pepper, and cayenne pepper to season the fish. This seasoning and process work well with other varieties of fish, shrimp, and chicken.

* [Mango Salsa]({{< ref "mango-salsa" >}})

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [cast-iron skillet](https://amzn.to/3akLyxk) or [heavy-bottomed pan](https://amzn.to/3o6BkHn)

#### How can I serve mahi-mahi? 

Oh, the options! Of course, you can serve it with our fresh [mango salsa]({{< ref "mango-salsa" >}}), and that is our personal favorite. 

* Break up the cooked fish and add it to a warmed corn tortilla for a blackened mahi-mahi taco. Top the taco with [mango salsa]({{< ref "mango-salsa" >}}) for even more flavor. 

* Serve the blackened mahi-mahi over rice or pilaf, or you can mix the fish with the rice and some black beans to make it a bowl. 

* Blackened mahi-mahi would be a great addition to any salad.

* Serve it as a blackened mahi-mahi sandwich on ciabatta bread with avocado, cabbage, butter lettuce, and [spicy mayo dressing]({{< ref "spicy-mayo-sauce" >}}). 

#### What to serve with blackened mahi-mahi? 

* Rice or pilaf 
* Risotto 
* A bed of greens like watercress or arugula treated with olive oil, salt, and pepper. 
* Grilled vegetables such as corn or asparagus 
* Red beans
