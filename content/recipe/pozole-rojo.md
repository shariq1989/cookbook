#### About the Meal 

Authentic Mexican pozole rojo is a rich stew often made with pork, hominy, and a variety of chillies that flavor the broth. I hope you enjoy this pozole recipe our family loves.

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Avocado Oil 

* Chilis: For this recipe, I use canned [chipotle in adobo sauce](https://amzn.to/2OIJBTR), and and combination of dried ancho and guajillo chillies. 

* Pork Butt or Shoulder

* White Onion

* Cumin

* Mexican Oregano

* Bay Leaves 

* Garlic Head 

* [Chicken Better Than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/3ErBboE)

* Hominy: I use canned hominy, but if you want to use dried hominy, you need to set aside extra time to prepare it.

* Garnish: Pozole is all about the garnish, at least for me; you get to make the stew your own with a variety of toppings. I usually garnish with radishes, red onion, cabbage, cilantro, lime wedges, avocado, chili flakes, and Mexican oregano.  

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* An [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3taIo6v)

#### Can I make a vegetarian Pozole? Vegan Pozole?

I make pozole for most of our holiday meals, and I often prepare this pozole recipe with hominy as the main ingredient since my sister is a vegetarian. Here are some adjustments you can make to this recipe to make it vegetarian and vegan-friendly. 

* Instead of Chicken Better than Bouillon, use [Vegetable Better than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/3dZTYx1)

* In place of meat, double the hominy, using 2 - 29 oz cans instead.   

#### Can I freeze pozole? 

You sure can. First, allow the stew to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe bag or container. Pozole can freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm the stew on the stovetop, prepare your toppings, and enjoy!
