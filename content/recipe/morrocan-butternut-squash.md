### ABOUT THE MEAL

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Butternut Squash: I use fresh butternut squash here, but you can also use frozen for convenience sake. Using frozen does change the texture some.   

* Brussel Sprouts

* Red Onion

* Olive Oil 

* [Ras El Hanout](https://amzn.to/3I2sGmj): I love how ras el hanout compliments the sweetness of the butternut squash. Like many spice blends, it differs from region to region, and there is no specific combination of spices that make up the spice blend. 

* Kosher Salt 

* Black Pepper

* Green Apple: I don't know about you, but I am not a fan of butternut squash texture on its own; this is why I prefer to add green apples. They add texture and tartness to an already sweet dish.

* Fresh Parsely 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3uG5Mdg) 

#### Is vegetarian? Is it vegan?

* This side dish is naturally vegetarian and vegan. 

#### Can I freeze baked butternut squash?

Yes you can; lay the leftover butternut in a single layer on a baking sheet and place them in the freezer until frozen through. Then, place the squash in a freezer-safe container or bag; the butternut squash will freeze for up to 3 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it in the oven. The texture will have changed some due to the freezing process, but the flavor will still be there.
