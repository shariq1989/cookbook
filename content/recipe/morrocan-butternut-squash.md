### About the Butternut Squash  

Butternut squash seasoned with ras el hanout is the perfect side dish to enjoy during the colder months. You can eat our Morrocan-spiced butternut squash on its own for a filling lunch, complement your main dish with a healthy side, or add it to the table for your next Thanksgiving or Christmas meal. Whatever you choose to do with it, I hope you enjoy this tasty butternut squash recipe our family loves.

#### What ingredients are needed to make Morrocan butternut squash?

* Butternut Squash: I use fresh butternut squash here, but you can use frozen for convenience sake. Using frozen butternut squash changes the texture quite a bit, and honestly, I am not a fan. I prefer the way fresh butternut squash crisps up in the oven.   

* Red Onion

* Olive Oil 

* [Ras El Hanout](https://amzn.to/3I2sGmj): The warm, aromatic spices of ras el hanout balance the sweetness of the butternut squash. Like many spice blends, it differs from region to region, so no two blends are the same. 

* Kosher Salt 

* Black Pepper

* Green Apple: You will love the texture and tartness of the green apples in this side dish. 

* Fresh Parsely 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3uG5Mdg) 

#### Is vegetarian? Is it vegan?

* This side dish is naturally vegetarian and vegan. 

#### Can I freeze baked butternut squash?

Yes, you can. Lay the leftover butternut in a single layer on a baking sheet and place them in the freezer until frozen. Then, place the squash in a freezer-safe container or bag; the butternut squash will freeze for up to 3 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it in the oven. The texture will have changed in the freezing process, but the flavor will still be there.
