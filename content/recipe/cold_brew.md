### ABOUT THE COFFEE

About 3 years ago now, my husband and I had a sit down about my iced coffee obsession. That conversation ended with the purchase of a Toddy. My life was changed from that very moment. Since then, I have successfully convinced many of my friends to purchase Toddy's of their own. And can I just say, the Toddy pays for itself right away. 

Another bones of cold brew at home is that it is less acidic. So if regular coffee upsets your stomach, there is a chance cold brew may not. 

#### What main ingredients are needed for cold brew?

* Coarse-Ground Coffee: Coarse groun makes the best cold brew. You can grind it at home or just use the giant one at Costco. Simply turn the dial to coarse ground and viola. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A coffee grinder or just use Costco's 
* A Toddy 
* A food scale

#### Can I warm up my cold brew? 

Yes, you sure can. In fact, that's the only way Shariq will drink it. On the occasion, I will too. Though, I love me an iced coffee.
