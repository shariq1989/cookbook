### ABOUT THE COFFEE

About 3 years ago now, my husband and I had a sit-down about my iced coffee obsession. That conversation ended with the purchase of a Toddy. My life changed at that very moment. Since then, I have successfully convinced many of my friends to purchase a Toddy of their own. And can I say, the Toddy pays for itself right away?

Another bonus of cold brew at home is that it is less acidic. If regular coffee upsets your stomach, there is a chance cold brew may not. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for cold brew?

* Coarse-Ground Coffee: Coarse ground makes the best cold brew. You can grind the coffee at home or use the giant one at Costco. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A coffee grinder 
* A Toddy 
* A food scale

#### Can I warm up my cold brew? 

Yes, you sure can. In fact, that's the only way Shariq will drink it. On occasion, I will too. Though, I love an iced coffee.
