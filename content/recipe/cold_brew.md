### ABOUT COLD BREW 

About 3 years ago my husband and I had a sit-down about my iced coffee obsession. Hello Dutch Bro's and Starbucks Cold Brew with Cascara Cold Foam, am I right? That conversation ended with the purchase of a new Cold Brew Toddy. My life has changed for the better since that moment. I have also successfully convinced many of my friends to purchase a Toddy of their own. Like me, I hope you experience the joy the comes with a quick cold brew coffee made right in your own home.


#### What is Cold Brew Coffee? What's the difference between Cold Brew and Iced Coffee? 

Cold-brew coffee refers to coffee made through steeping grounds at room temperature or in cold water for an extended period. 

The difference between the two comes down to methodology. Cold Brew steeps in cold or room temperature water rather than hot water like regular iced coffee. At a cooler temperature, the beans maintain their integrity; the coffee ends up less watered-down. Along the same line, cold-brewing coffee relies on time to extract the coffee's oils rather than a burst of hot water. Because of the extended brewing time, the result is a smooth, tasty coffee with a low level of acidity. If you're like me and regular coffee tends to be hard on your stomach, cold brew may be just the thing for you. 

#### What main ingredients do I need to make cold brew?

* Coarse-Ground Coffee: Coarse ground makes for the best cold brew coffee. You can grind your coffee at home with a [coffee grinder](https://amzn.to/2XU1KSU) or use a commercial one inside of stores like Costco. 

* Water 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [coffee grinder](https://amzn.to/2XU1KSU)

* A [Toddy](https://amzn.to/3CMQ03P) Cold Brew System: The Toddy is hands-down the best cold brew coffee maker. It is the cold brew maker most used in coffee shops as well.

#### Can I warm up cold brew concentrate if I want the taste, but enjoy a warm cup of coffee on occasion? 

You sure can. In fact, that's the only way Shariq, will drink it. On occasion, I will too. Though, I generally prefer a cold coffee. If you decide to go this route, I suggest filling your mug 1/3 of the way with cold brew and then top it with boiled water leaving room for cream and sweetener of your choice. Sip, and enjoy! 

#### What is the best coffee for Cold Brew? 

First off, you want to be sure you're purchasing whole beans and grinding them on a coarse-ground setting. My all-time favorite coffee for cold brew at home is [New Mexico Pi√±on Coffee](https://amzn.to/3CRCiwz).
