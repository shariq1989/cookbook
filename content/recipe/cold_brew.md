### ABOUT THE COFFEE

About 3 years ago my husband and I had a sit-down about my iced coffee obsession. Hello Dutch Bro's and Starbucks Cold Brew with Cascara Cold Foam, am I right? That conversation ended with the purchase of a Cold Brew [Toddy](https://amzn.to/3CMQ03P). My life has changed since that moment. I have also successfully convinced many of my friends to purchase a Toddy of their own. And can I say, the Toddy pays for itself right away? Another side benefit of making cold brew at home is that it tends to be less acidic. If regular coffee upsets your stomach, there is a chance cold brew may not.
