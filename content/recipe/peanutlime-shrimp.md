* 1 tsp Smoked Paprika
* 1/2 tsp Cayenne Powder 
* 2 Garlic Clove, minced
* 1 ⅛ tsp Sugar, divided
* ⅛ tsp Red Pepper Flakes

6.  Add the shrimp in a single layer and cook over medium-high heat until the edges turn pink- about 2-3 minutes.
7. Use tongs to flip each shrimp and cook the other side for another minute. Then, transfer the shrimp to a plate.
8. Add the remaining teaspoon of oil to the [skillet](https://amzn.to/31ddzW7), followed by the reserved spice mixture and peanuts. Cook over medium heat until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
