* 1 tbsp [Beef](https://amzn.to/3oM8L3W) or [Vegetable](https://amzn.to/3Atsuay) Better than Bouillon 
* 1/2 tsp Soy Sauce 
* 1 tsp [Gochochang](https://amzn.to/2NHrNZ3)
* 1 cup [Shitake Mushrooms](https://amzn.to/3I0K0YN), dried, optional 

For the Jjigae: 

* 1 small White Onion, coarsely chopped
* 3 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 8 Scallions, whites, and greens separated- whites, cut in 1-inch pieces- greens, thinly sliced
* 1 tbsp [Sesame Oil](https://amzn.to/3b72o2v), plus 2 tsp for the paste

* ½ tsp Kosher Salt
* 2 tablespoons [Gochugaru](https://amzn.to/2P1lLmx)
* ¼ tsp Ground Black Pepper

#### Stove-Top Instructions

1. In a [saucepan](https://amzn.to/3oKaYN7), add the water, fish sauce, soy sauce, Gochochang, and Better than Bouillon. If you're adding dried mushrooms to the dish, you can also add them during this step to re-hydrate them. Cover and cook for 10-15 minutes over medium heat, adjusting the temperature to maintain a gentle simmer. 
2. While the stock is cooking, make a paste using the Gochugaru, 2 tsp sesame oil, and ground black pepper. Set aside. 
3. In a [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3lC91Pi) or [earthenware pot](https://amzn.to/3soWXDL), saute the kimchi until it becomes soft. Set it aside. 
4. In the same [pot]((https://amzn.to/3lC91Pi)), add 1 tbsp sesame oil over medium heat. Then add the onion, garlic, and the scallion whites. Cook until onions become translucent and soften for about 8 minutes. 
5. Add the reserved stock. Cover cook for 5-7 minutes over medium heat. Then, open and stir in the reserved Kimchi.
6. Next, add the tofu and let the mixture simmer for a few minutes before gently stirring in the spice mixture- careful not to break up the tofu. 
7. Garnish with extra Gochugaru if you prefer spicy kimchi jjigae, and serve with a side of sticky rice. 

#### Instant Pot Instructions

1. In a [saucepan](https://amzn.to/3oKaYN7), add the water, fish sauce, soy sauce, Gochochang, and Better than Bouillon. If you're adding dried mushrooms to the dish, you can also add them during this step to re-hydrate them. Cover and cook for 10-15 minutes over medium heat, adjusting the temperature to maintain a gentle simmer. 
2. While the stock is cooking, make a paste using the Gochugaru, 2 tsp sesame oil, and ground black pepper. Set aside. 
3. In an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3DpZGSo), cook the Kimchi on saute mode until it becomes soft. Set it aside. 
4. Back in the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3DpZGSo), add 1 tbsp sesame oil over medium heat. Then add the onion, garlic, and the scallion whites. Cook until onions become translucent and soften for about 8 minutes. 
5. Add the reserved stock. Secure the lid on the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3DpZGSo), and cook on manual high pressure for 5 minutes. Do a quick release, and stir in the reserved Kimchi.
6. Next, add the tofu and set the[ Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3DpZGSo) to saute mode for a few minutes before gently stirring in the spice mixture- careful not to break up the tofu.

### ABOUT THE MEAL

Kimchi jjigae, kimchi chigae, kimchi stew, or kimchi soup (whichever name you choose to call it) is quickly becoming a favorite in our home. This is mainly due to its flexible ingredients and how easy it is to make. This kimchi tofu soup is rich and flavorful and can be made on the stove-top or in an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3DpZGSo).

#### What are the main kimchi jjigae ingredients?

* [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/3uYz9IW)

* [Beef](https://amzn.to/3oM8L3W) or [Vegetable](https://amzn.to/3Atsuay) Better than Bouillon 

* Soy Sauce 

* [Gochochang](https://amzn.to/2NHrNZ3)

* [Shitake Mushrooms](https://amzn.to/3I0K0YN), dried, optional 

* Onion

* Garlic

* Scallions

* [Sesame Oil]

* Kimchi: Guess what? Kimchi is not just a side dish in Korean cuisine; it is often the main ingredient for many recipes. 

* Package Extra-Firm Tofu: I use large, rectangular slices in my soup, and while traditional kimchi jjigae usually includes meat, we stick with tofu as the main protein. Occasionally, I will add shiitake mushrooms, fresh or dried, to change things up a bit. 

* Kosher Salt

* [Gochugaru](https://amzn.to/2P1lLmx)

* Black Pepper

#### How do you create the broth for kimchi jjigae? 

A more [traditional Korean broth](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/kimchi-jjigae) includes dried anchovy, kelp, and daikon radish, all of which create a delicious base for kimchi stew. Since these ingredients can be difficult to come by, I use staples from my pantry instead. Note: If you prefer more of the Kimchi flavor in your jjigae, consider adding 1-2 tbsp of the kimchi brine to flavor your broth as well. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [saucepan](https://amzn.to/3oKaYN7)
* A small bowl 
* A [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3lC91Pi), [earthenware pot](https://amzn.to/3soWXDL), or [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3DpZGSo)

#### Is kimchi jjigae vegetarian? Is it vegan?

To make this kimchi stew recipe vegetarian and vegan-friendly, omit the fish sauce, and be sure to use [Vegetable Better than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/3f8LK6e). 

#### Can I freeze kimchi soup? 

You sure can, but before freezing, remove the tofu from the dish. It doesn't reheat well once frozen. Then, add the rest of the stew to a freezer-safe container or bag. The kimchi stew will freeze for up to 3 months.
