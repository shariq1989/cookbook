### About the Pickled Onions  

Want to spice up your salad, sandwich, taco, or burger? Transform your raw, red onions from pungent and crunchy to an irresistibly tangy topping with this recipe for quick pickled red onions.

#### What ingredients are needed for this side?

* Red Onion: I like pickled red onion, but use whatever onion variety you prefer. Be sure to slice the onions thinly; this helps them maintain crispness. You want them to be no thicker than 1/4-inch. 

* Vinegar: I use a combination of apple cider vinegar and distilled white vinegar to pickle the onions. 

* Himalayan Salt

* Honey: I use honey to sweeten the onions and balance the vinegar; you can use sugar or syrup. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [glass jar](https://amzn.to/3ETyuvT) with a lid
* A [saucepan](https://amzn.to/3mQuO8a) 

#### Are pickled onions vegetarian? Are they vegan?

This recipe is naturally vegetarian. To make it vegan, use sugar or syrup to sweeten the mixture instead of honey. 

#### How do I store pickled onions?

After the onions have cooled, seal the [glass jar](https://amzn.to/3ETyuvT) and refrigerate it. The onions will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 weeks. 

#### How can I use pickled red onions? 

Use pickled onions to dress up all kinds of dishes, like tacos or burritos; they are great on our [Chorizo Breakfast Burrito]({{< ref "chorizo-burrito" >}}). You can also add them to burgers, sandwiches, bean, lentils, soups, pitas, and salads, or use them as a side to go along with BBQ pulled meats like our [carnitas]({{< ref "carnitas" >}}).
