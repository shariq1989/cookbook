### How to Make P.F. Chang's Lettuce Wrap Copycat 

#### INGREDIENTS

* 1 lb Ground Beef,lean 
* 2 Garlic Cloves, minced 
* 2 tsp Ginger, minced 
* 4 Scallions, sliced and whites and greens, separated 
* 1 tbsp Soy Sauce 
* 1 tbsp [Rice Wine Vinegar](https://amzn.to/3feHUZc) 
* 3 tsp Sriracha 
* 1/4 cup Homemade Hoisin, plus more for garnish
* Butter Lettuce, washed and patted dry 
* 1 tsp [Chili Oil](https://amzn.to/3piBFay)
* 1/2 cup Peanuts, toasted, to garnish 

For the Homemade Hoisin Sauce: 

* 4 tbsp Soy Sauce 
* 1 tsp Ginger Paste 
* 1 1/2 tbsp [Sesame Oil](https://amzn.to/3b72o2v) 
* 1 1/2 tbsp [Rice Wine Vinegar](https://amzn.to/3feHUZc)
* 1 1/2 tbsp [Monk Fruit Sweetener](https://amzn.to/38Bp8aG) or Honey 
* 1 tbsp Natural [Almond Butter Powder](https://amzn.to/3laVGgE)

#### INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Before cooking, whisk the ingredients for the homemade hoisin sauce in a small bowl. Set aside. 
2. In a [skillet](https://amzn.to/3xyWEtj), warm sesame oil over medium heat, and then add the ground beef. Break up the meat with a [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/38BSlBY) until finely minced. Cook until beef is cooked through about 8-10 minutes.  
3. While the meat is cooking, mix the garlic, ginger, scallion whites, soy sauce, white wine vinegar, and sriracha into a small bowl. Stir the mixture into the beef, along with the homemade hoisin.
4. Cover the mixture with a lid and simmer for about 5 minutes. 
5. Remove the lid and lower the heat, allow the beef mixture to reduce, about 2-5 minutes. 
6. While the meat is cooking, prepare another [skillet](https://amzn.to/3xyWEtj) with chili oil over medium-high heat. Toast the peanuts until they turn light brown. Set aside. 
7. Remove from heat. To serve, spoon the mixture into the butter lettuce. Garnish with scallion greens and the reserved toasted peanuts. Use the leftover hoisin as a dipping sauce alongside the lettuce wraps.

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

There are many versions of this copycat on the internet; this is the Jamil Family take on the popular dish. These lettuce wraps are healthy, but more importantly, they're easy to make! There are very few recipes that make it to the regular rotation in our home, but this is one of them. Best of all, they are both adult and kid-approved. 

#### What ingredients do I need for this meal?

* [Sesame Oil](https://amzn.to/3b72o2v)

* Ground Beef: Lean ground beef is our preferred meat to use, but ground chicken or turkey would work fine. Whatever meat you use, be sure that it is finely minced; I use a [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/38BSlBY) to make my job easier. 

* Garlic 

* Ginger

* Scallions

* Soy Sauce 

* [Rice Wine Vinegar](https://amzn.to/3feHUZc) 

* Sriracha 

* Homemade Hoisin: While store-bought hoisin is super tasty, it's high in sugar content. If you're concerned about sugar, like our family, we recommend making the homemade hoisin sauce suggested in the recipe. If you don't have the ingredients or the time to make your own, store-bought hoisin will be fine. 

* Butter Lettuce

* [Chili Oil](https://amzn.to/3piBFay)

* Peanuts

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* 2 small bowls
* 2 [skillets](https://amzn.to/3xyWEtj)
* A [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/38BSlBY)

#### Are these lettuce wraps keto? Are they low-carb?

#### Can I freeze the beef?

Yes, first allow the meat to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. To prevent freezer burn, you can also layer plastic wrap over the dish before securing the lid. The beef mixture will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your lettuce and hoisin sauce.
