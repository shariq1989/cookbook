### ABOUT THE MEAL 

We love this meal because it is healthy and fresh, but also easy to make. The crunch from the peanuts, the warmth of the spices, and the zest of the lime will leave you wanting more.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Shrimp: Use any size shrimp, but be sure to adjust the cooking time accordingly. I recommend using extra-large or even colossal shrimp. 

* Spices: I use a combination of peppercorns, coriander, paprika, cayenne, and salt to season the shrimp.  

* Peanuts: Peanuts bring a necessary crunch and add a rich nutty flavor to the existing spices. 

* Lime 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A small bowl 
* A spice grinder, coffee grinder, or [mortar and pestle](https://amzn.to/3ur2t9e)
* A [large skillet](https://amzn.to/2PGxMhz)

#### How can I store my leftovers?

I would not recommend freezing the shrimp. However, leftovers will keep in the fridge for 2-4 days in an air-tight container.
