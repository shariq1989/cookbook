#### INGREDIENTS

For the Filling:

* 2 tbsp Butter, melted
* 1/2 cup Brown Sugar, packed
* 3 tsp Cinnamon, ground
* 1/8 tsp Salt
* 1/4 cup White Granulated Sugar

For the Cinnamon Rolls: 

* 3 cups All-Purpose Flour, plus more for rolling the dough
* 2 tbsp White Granulated Sugar
* 1 1/4 tbsp Baking Powder 
* 1/2 tsp Baking Soda 
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 1 1/4 cup Buttermilk

#### INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees and combine the ingredients for the filling in a small bowl. Mix well and set aside. 
2. In a large bowl, add all of the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. 
3. Whisk the buttermilk, 5 tbsp melted butter, and vanilla together in a separate bowl, and then pour the mixture into the middle of the reserved dry ingredients. Combine until the dough comes forms. Do not overmix. Knead the dough and form a ball.
4. On a lightly floured surface, roll the ball into a rectangle. Cover it with the reserved filling, leaving some room on all four sides of the dough. Sprinkle it lightly with cinnamon and roll it up into a tube. Slightly trim the ends and cut into even slices, about 10. 
5. Prepare a baking dish with butter or spray and then fill it with the rolls. 
6. Brush the tops of the cinnamon rolls with the remaining melted butter and bake for 17 minutes. This cooking time is for high elevation; adjust the time for lower elevation.
7. While the rolls are baking, let's make the icing. Using a hand mixer, blend the softened butter, then add the vanilla. Slowly stir in the powdered sugar until smooth, and then whisk in the milk. Set aside. 
8.  Retrieve the cinnamon rolls from the oven, allow them to cool for 5 minutes and then drizzle them with the frosting.


### ABOUT THE CINNAMON ROLLS 

You can't beat a warm batch of cinnamon rolls, and during the first round of Covid quarantine, we were craving that little bit of comfort in our home. The only problem, we couldn't find yeast anywhere; we had to find a way to make cinnamon rolls without it. 

With this recipe, you still get all the yummy goodness of cinnamon rolls, but without the prepping and proofing that comes from using yeast to make your dough. By omitting the yeast from the recipe and replacing it with baking powder, it decreases the preparation time, meaning you can get the cinnamon rolls to the table even quicker. 

#### What main ingredients are needed for these cinnamon rolls?

* All-Purpose Flour: I haven't explored this recipe with other flour alternatives.

* Milk: I recommend using whole milk, but you can also use orange juice instead.  

* Butter: I use salted butter, but you could use unsalted as well. 

* Cinnamon: This is an essential ingredient in these cinnamon rolls; make sure you are using quality ground cinnamon. 

* Baking Powder: Baking powder is used instead of yeast in this recipe. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* 3 small bowls
* A large bowl
* A [hand-mixer](https://amzn.to/2OXaeEn) 
* A [baking dish](https://amzn.to/3r23qTr)
* A set of [measuring spoons and cups](https://amzn.to/2QjG2UR)

#### Can I make these cinnamon rolls vegan?

To make the cinnamon rolls vegan, you will need to make a few substitutions: 

* Butter: Opt for vegan butter. 

* Milk: You can use orange juice instead, which lends a yummy citrus flavor to the cinnamon rolls as well. 

* Buttermilk: You can use almond milk as an alternative, but stir in 1 tsp of lemon juice before using it. 

#### How should I store my cinnamon rolls? 

If you somehow ended up with leftover cinnamon rolls, they will keep at room temperature for a few days. Place the leftovers onto a plate and cover them with aluminum foil. 

#### Can I freeze cinnamon rolls?

I do not recommend freezing already baked rolls unless you bake them and leave the frosting off of them. I often make two batches instead; I bake one and then freeze the other rolls for quick baking next time. To freeze, all you have to do is gather the rolls together and wrap them tightly in Saran wrap, then place them into a freezer-safe bag. The rolls will keep for up to 2 months. When you're ready to eat, let them defrost in the refrigerator overnight. Prepare the icing, warm your cinnamon rolls in the oven according to the baking instructions, and enjoy.
