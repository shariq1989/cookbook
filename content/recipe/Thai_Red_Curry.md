Servings: 3-4 <!--more-->

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1- 4 oz Maesri Thai Red Curry Paste, whole can for spicy, 1/2 can for mild
* 1/2 tsp Ginger Paste
* 1/3 White Onion, thinly sliced
* 3-4 Chicken thighs, boneless, skinless, cut into 1-inch pieces 
* 1/2 Red Bell Pepper, thinly sliced 
* 1 small Zucchini, thinly sliced into rounds 
* 1- 14 oz can Arroy-D Coconut Milk, plus more if you prefer less spicy 
* 1 tbsp Fish Sauce
* 1/2 cup Mushrooms of your choice, quartered
* Thai Basil, for garnish 

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Warm the red curry paste and ginger paste in a pan over medium heat, stirring occasionally until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
2. Add the onions and chicken to the pan and stir to coat, fry for 3-5 minutes. Add the bell peppers and zucchini and saute for 1 minute.
3. Stir in half of the coconut milk and bring the curry to a boil.
4. Reduce the heat to a simmer and add the remaining coconut milk and fish sauce, along with the mushrooms. Allow the mixture to cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes. The sauce should thicken and the vegetables will reach a crisp-tenderness. If curry does not thicken, add 2 tbsp cold water and stir to mix.
5. Garnish with Thai basil leaves and serve with jasmine rice.
