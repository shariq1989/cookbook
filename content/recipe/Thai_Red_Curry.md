Servings: 3-4 <!--more-->

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1- 4 oz Maesri Thai Red Curry Paste, whole can for spicy, 1/2 can for mild
* 1/2 tsp Ginger Paste
* 1/2 White Onion, thinly sliced
* 1 lb Chicken thighs, boneless, skinless, cut into 1-inch pieces 
* 1 Red Bell Pepper, thinly sliced 
* 1 small Zucchini, thinly sliced into rounds 
* 1- 14 oz Aroy-D Coconut Milk, plus more if you prefer less spicy 
* 1 tbsp Fish Sauce
* 1/2 cup Mushrooms of your choice, quartered
* Kosher Salt, to taste 
* Thai Basil, for garnish 

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Warm the red curry and ginger pastes in a pan over medium heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes. 
2. Add the onions and chicken and stir to coat, fry for 3-5 minutes. 
3. Add the bell peppers and zucchini and saute for 1 minute.
4. Mix in half of the coconut milk and bring curry to a boil. 
5. Reduce the heat to simmer and add the remaining coconut milk and fish sauce, along with the mushrooms. Allow the mixture to cook, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. The sauce should thicken and the vegetables will reach a crisp-tenderness. 
6. Garnish with thai basil and serve with jasmine rice.
