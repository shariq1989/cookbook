Servings: 3-4 <!--more-->

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1/2 tbsp Coconut Oil 
* 1- 4 oz Maesri Thai Red Curry Paste 
* 1/2 White Onion, thinly sliced
* 1 lb Chicken thighs, boneless, skinless, cut into 1-inch pieces 
* 1 Red Bell Pepper, thinly sliced 
* 1 small Zucchini, quartered
* 2 tsp Fresh Ginger, minced
* 4 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 1- 14 oz Aroy-D Coconut Milk 
* 1 tbsp Fish Sauce
* Kosher Salt, to taste 
* Lime Wedges, for garnish 
* Thai Basil, for garnish 

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Warm coconut oil over medium heat in large skillet. 
2. Mix in the red curry paste and stir, about 2 minutes, until aromatic. 
3. Add the onions and chicken and stir to coat with the mixture, fry for about 3-5 minutes. 
4. Add the bell peppers, zucchini, ginger and garlic and saute for 1 minute.
5. Mix in half of the coconut milk and bring the curry to a boil. 
6. Reduce the heat to simmer and add the remaining coconut milk along with the fish sauce. Allow the mixture to cook, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. The sauce should thicken and the vegetables will reach a crisp-tenderness. 
8. Season with salt, if necessary. 
9. Garnish with thai basil and lime wedges and serve with jasmine rice.
