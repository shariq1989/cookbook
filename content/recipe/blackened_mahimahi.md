### ABOUT THE MEAL

If you're looking for a lean, healthy fish that doesn't taste too fishy, mahi-mahi is the one for you. This recipe flavors the filets with warm spices and butter to create a tasty, blackened crust from cooking in the cast-iron skillet over high heat. I garnish the mahi-mahi with fresh mango salsa making it the perfect summer meal.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Mahi-Mahi: For this recipe, I use frozen fish filets from Costco, but you can use fresh if you prefer. Mahi-mahi is versatile and cooks well, but keep in mind; this is a lean fish. Be careful not to overcook it, or it will dry out. 

Butter 

* Blackening Seasonings: Blackening is a cooking technique often used in the preparation of fish. I use a tasty combination of chili powder, garlic powder, oregano, smoked paprika, salt, cumin, black pepper, and cayenne pepper to season the fish. This seasoning and process work well with chicken also.

#### How can I serve the mahi-mahi? 

Oh, the options, though the fish topped with mango salsa itself is pretty incredible. Another option would be to break up the fish and add it to a warmed corn tortilla for a mahi-mahi taco. You could still add the mango salsa and even top it with our cream avocado dressing if you wanted even more flavor. This meal also pairs well with brown rice or rice pilaf.
