### ABOUT THE MEAL

If you're looking for a lean, healthy fish that doesn't taste too fishy, mahi-mahi is the one for you. The fish is flavored with warm spices and butter to create a tasty, blackened crust perfected by cooking in the cast-iron skillet on high heat. I garnish the mahi-mahi with fresh [mango salsa](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/mango_salsa/), making it the perfect summer meal.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Mahi-Mahi: For this recipe, I use frozen fish filets from Costco, but you can use fresh. Mahi-mahi is versatile and cooks well, but keep in mind; this is a lean fish. Be careful not to overcook it, or it will dry out. 

* Butter 

* Blackening Seasonings: Blackening is a cooking technique often used in the preparation of fish. I use a tasty combination of chili powder, garlic powder, oregano, smoked paprika, salt, cumin, black pepper, and cayenne pepper to season the fish. This seasoning and process work well with chicken also.

#### How can I serve the mahi-mahi? 

Oh, the options! Of course, you can serve it as is with fresh mango salsa. Break up the cooked fish and add it to a warmed corn tortilla for a mahi-mahi taco. You can still add the mango salsa and even top it with our cream avocado dressing if you wanted even more flavor. You can make a mahi-mahi bowl by topping rice or pilaf with fresh and mango salsa.
