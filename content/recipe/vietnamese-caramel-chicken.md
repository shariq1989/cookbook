### About the Meal 

You will love this one pan, Vietnamese-inspired chicken. It's cooked in a sticky-sweet base of coconut water and caramelized shallots and ginger; it packs the heat with the use of fresh chilies. While cooking, it will look like plain chicken up until the last few minutes, when it will caramelize right before your eyes. I top ours with fresh cilantro, thinly sliced serrano chilies, and a bit of lime zest. I hope you enjoy this Vietnamese caramel chicken recipe our family loves.

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* White Sugar 

* Coconut Water 

* [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/33GYOJj): You may decide to skip this ingredient because it's unfamiliar, don't. Fish sauce is an ingredient we always have in our home, and it is used frequently in Vietnamese cuisine. [Red Boat](https://amzn.to/3AO5rJ4) fish sauce is our favored brand and won't give off a fishy aroma as other brands do.

* Shallots: Bites with shallot will be your favorite of the whole meal. They lend the perfect sweetness and pair well with the sugar and coconut water to bring about a beautiful caramelization.

* Fresh Ginger

* Lime Zest 

* Chicken Thighs: I use boneless, skinless chicken thighs because they nestle into the pan and caramelize well alongside the shallots, sugar, and coconut water. 

* Black Pepper

* Kosher Salt

* Cilantro

* Serrano or Thai Green Chili

* Chicken Thighs: 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [saute pan](https://amzn.to/3yMZYQH) or [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/2VthKua)
