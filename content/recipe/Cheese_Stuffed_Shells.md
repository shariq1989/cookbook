Preparation Time: 1 hour

Cuisine: Sicilian 

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 10-15 [Jumbo Pasta Shells](https://amzn.to/3rUskFr), cooked al dente
* 1/2 cup [Basil Pesto Sauce](https://amzn.to/3qmNs6S), plus more to garnish
* 2 cups Spinach, steamed and wilted, blotted dry with a cloth
* 15 oz package Ricotta Cheese
* 1 Egg
* 3-5 Garlic Cloves, minced
* Course Black Pepper, to taste
* 1/2 cup Parmesan Cheese, shredded, plus more to garnish
* 1 cup Basil
* 2 tbsp [Pine Nuts](https://amzn.to/3amamWp), toasted 

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Cook your pasta shells according to the package, to al dente, and strain. Steam the spinach until it becomes wilted. Set both aside. 
2. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. 
3. In a mixing bowl, blend the ricotta cheese and egg. Stir in the minced garlic, wilted spinach, and parmesan cheese. Season the mixture with pepper, to taste. 
4. Prepare a baking dish and spread basil pesto sauce into an even layer along the bottom. 
5. Divide the cheese mixture among cooked pasta shells, stuffing each shell with about 2 tbsp of the cheese mixture. 
6. Align shells in the baking dish side by side, with the opening of shells facing upright. 
7. Drizzle more of the basil pesto sauce over top, then sprinkle parmesan cheese in an even layer. 
8. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, bake for 50 minutes. 9. Remove foil and cook for 5 minutes. If you prefer cheese to be browned, broil for 1-2 minutes.

#### ABOUT THE MEAL

Who doesn't love stuffed shells? This meal finds its origin in Sicily but they are ever popular in American homes, and for good reason. They give elegant and fancy vibes but are quite easy to make. We chose to deviate from the classic stuffed shell with marinara in favor of shells stuffed full of cheese and spinach and topped with pesto and pine nuts. We love the versatility of stuffed shells being that they can be made vegetarian or meatless.
