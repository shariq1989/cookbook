#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Cook pasta shells according to the package, to al dente, and strain.

3. In a mixing bowl, blend together ricotta cheese and egg. Stir in minced garlic, wilted spinach, and parmesan cheese. Season the mixture with pepper, to taste. 
4. Prepare a baking dish and spread basil pesto sauce into an even layer along bottom. 
5. Divide the cheese mixture among cooked pasta shells, stuffing each shell with about 2 tbsp of the cheese mixture. 
6. Align shells in the baking dish side by side, with the opening of shells facing upright.

8. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, bake 50 minutes.
