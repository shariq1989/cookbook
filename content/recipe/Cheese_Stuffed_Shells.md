Servings: 5 <!--more-->

Preparation Time: 1 hour

Cuisine: Sicilian 

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 10-15 [Jumbo Pasta Shells](https://amzn.to/3rUskFr), cooked al dente
* 1/2 cup Basil Pesto Sauce, plus more to garnish
* 1 tsp Olive Oil, plus more to prepare the baking dish
* 2 cups Spinach, steamed and wilted, blotted dry with a cloth
* 15 oz package Ricotta Cheese
* 1 Egg
* 3-5 Garlic Cloves, minced
* Course Black Pepper, to taste
* 1/2 cup Parmesan Cheese, shredded, plus more to garnish
* 1 cup Basil
* 2 tbsp [Pine Nuts](https://amzn.to/3amamWp), toasted 

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Cook the pasta shells according to the package, to al dente, and strain. Set them aside. 
2. In a small skillet, saute the spinach with 1 tsp of olive oil until they are wilted. Set aside. 
3. Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees. 
4. In a large bowl, mix the ricotta cheese and egg. Then stir in the minced garlic, wilted spinach, and parmesan cheese. Season the mixture with coarse ground pepper, to taste. 
5. Prepare a 9x10 baking dish with a light layer of olive oil and then layer some of the basil pesto sauce along the bottom of the dish. 
6. Divide the cheese mixture into cooked pasta shells, filling each shell with 2 tbsp of the cheese mixture. 
7. Line the shells in the baking dish, facing upright. The shells need to face upright or the filling will spill into the pan. 
8. Drizzle more basil pesto sauce over top and then sprinkle with parmesan cheese. 
9. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 50 minutes. 
10. Remove the foil and cook for another 5-8 minutes. If your cheese hasn't begun to brown, you can broil for 1-2 minutes to achieve the desired effect. 

#### ABOUT THE MEAL

Stuffed shells find their origin in Sicily, but they are ever-popular worldwide and for good reason. Why are they so loved? Well, I think it has something to do with their elegant appeal and the ease with which they are made. For this dish, we chose to stray from the traditional stuffed shell made in marinara sauce in favor of shells stuffed to the brim with ricotta cheese and spinach and topped with basil pesto and pine nuts. I appreciate the classic stuffed shells, but this version is tasty if you wanted to try something new. 

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Jumbo Pasta Shells: Be sure to cook the shells al dente, according to the package. I even suggest cooking them a little less to ensure they hold up in the stuffing and baking process.  

* Ricotta Cheese: This light and creamy cheese contributes to the savoriness of the meal. To avoid a watery filling, I suggest draining the ricotta cheese. If necessary, spread it onto a baking sheet and dab it with a paper towel to soak up any excess moisture. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

You will need a pan large enough to boil the pasta shells. You will also need a small skillet, a large mixing bowl, and a 9 x 13 baking dish. 

#### Are stuffed shells vegetarian? Are stuffed shells vegan? 

While the stuffed shells are vegetarian, this recipe does not cater to the vegan diet. 

#### Can I freeze my leftover stuffed shells? 

Yes, you can. First, allow the shells to cool completely and then add them to a freezer-safe container. Cover them in saran wrap to prevent freezer burn before putting on the lid. They will freeze for up to 3 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, defrost the shells in the refrigerator overnight and bake the shells from frozen, adding 30 minutes to the original baking time to ensure that the shells are heated throughout.
