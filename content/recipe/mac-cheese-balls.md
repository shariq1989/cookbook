### About the Mac and Cheese Balls 

Do you ever get bored making the same meal over and over? This scenario described the kids and me during the 2020 quarantine. We love macaroni in our home, so we decided to attempt a fun spin on a classic comfort dish and give mac and cheese balls a try. I am forever grateful that we did. These deep-fried mac and cheese balls are tasty, kid-friendly, and adult-approved, especially with a side of Sriracha aioli.  

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal? 

* Macaroni and Cheese: I use Kraft Mac and Cheese for this recipe, but you can use homemade mac and cheese if you prefer. 

* [Panko Mix](https://amzn.to/3pPj9GP) 

* Garlic Powder 

* Cayenne Powder

* Red Chili Flakes

* Eggs

* Canola Oil 

* Mayonnaise: We live in North Carolina now, and here there is only one choice for mayo, [Duke's](https://amzn.to/3II1R7d) it is. 

* [Sriracha](https://amzn.to/3EVlUwQ)  

#### Cooking Notes for the mac and cheese balls: 

* Chill the mac and cheese: You will want to chill your mac and cheese before making the balls. They need at least 6 hours to cool, but I suggest preparing the mac and cheese ahead of time and giving yourself 24 hours. This recipe is also a great way to use your kids' lunch leftovers or any of that Thanksgiving mac and cheese that somehow didn't get eaten. 

* Drain the excess egg: After you dip the mac and cheese balls in the egg mixture, be sure to let any excess drain off. You want just enough so that the panko will stick, but you don't want it to become soggy. 

* Don't crowd the pan with mac and cheese balls: If you add too many mac and cheese balls to the oil, it will cause the temperature to drop. I recommend frying three balls at a time. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3DiW6ce)
* A [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3ogWGCW)
* A plate 
* A small bowl 
* A [Dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3IgoUFP)
* A [food thermometer](https://amzn.to/3IgANM3)
* A slotted spoon

#### What other ways can I cook mac and cheese balls? 

If you don't want deep-fried mac and cheese balls, you can bake them in the oven for 2-25 minutes at 350 degrees until golden brown and flipping halfway through. Another option is to make mac and cheese bites in the air fryer. Settle the balls into the tray and cook for 10 minutes at 360 degrees.
