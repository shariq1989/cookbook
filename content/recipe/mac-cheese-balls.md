### How to Make Mac and Cheese Balls 

#### Ingredients 

For the Mac and Cheese Balls: 

* 2 Boxes of Macaroni and Cheese, cooked and chilled
* 2 cups Panko Mix 
* 1/2 tsp Garlic Powder 
* 1/4 tsp Cayenne Powder
* 1/4 tsp Red Chili Flakes
* 2 Eggs
* 6 cups Canola Oil 

For the Sriracha Aioli: 
* 2 tbsp Mayonnaise
* 1 tbsp Sriracha 

#### Instructions  

1. Make the boxed macaroni and cheese and refrigerate for 24 hours.
2. Prepare a [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3DiW6ce) over a [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3ogWGCW) covered with aluminum foil. 
3. Scoop 2 tablespoons of macaroni and cheese and shape into a 2-inch ball. Set aside and repeat until the mixture is gone. 
4. On a plate, mix the panko, garlic powder, cayenne powder, and chili flakes. 
5. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs until smooth. 
6. Dip the balls into the egg mixture and roll in the panko, creating a solid crust. Repeat until each one of the balls is covered. 
7. Heat the oil in a [Dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3IgoUFP) until it reaches 350 degrees. Fry 6 cheese balls at a time for about 3 minutes each until golden. Move to the [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3DiW6ce) to drain and cool before serving.
