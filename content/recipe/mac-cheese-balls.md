### How to Make Mac and Cheese Balls 

#### Ingredients 

For the Mac and Cheese Balls: 

* 2 Boxes of Macaroni and Cheese, cooked according to the package, and chilled
* 2 cups [Panko Mix](https://amzn.to/3pPj9GP) 
* 1/2 tsp Garlic Powder 
* 1/4 tsp Cayenne Powder

For the Sriracha Aioli:

* 1 tbsp [Sriracha](https://amzn.to/3EVlUwQ) 

#### Instructions  

1. Cook the macaroni and cheese according to the package, and then refrigerate for 24 hours.
2. Prepare a [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3DiW6ce) over a [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3ogWGCW) covered with aluminum foil. 
3. Scoop about 2 tablespoons of macaroni and cheese into your palm and shape into a 2-inch ball. Set aside and repeat until the mixture is gone. 
4. On a plate, combine the panko, garlic powder, cayenne powder, and chili flakes. 
5. Whisk the eggs in a small bowl until smooth. 
6. Dip the mac and cheese balls into the egg mixture and then roll in the panko, creating a solid crust. Repeat until each one of the balls is coated.
