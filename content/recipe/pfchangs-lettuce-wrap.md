2. In a [skillet](https://amzn.to/3xyWEtj), warm sesame oil over medium heat and add the ground beef. Break up the meat with a [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/38BSlBY) until finely minced. Cook until beef browns for about 8-10 minutes.  
3. While the meat is cooking, add the onion and carrots to the beef. Cook until the onions soften, about 5 minutes.

7. While the lettuce wrap mixture is cooking, prepare another [skillet](https://amzn.to/3xyWEtj) with chili oil over medium-high heat. Toast the peanuts until they turn light brown. Set aside. 
8. Remove from heat. To serve, spoon the mixture into the butter lettuce. Garnish with scallion greens and the reserved toasted peanuts. Use the leftover hoisin as a dipping sauce alongside the lettuce wraps.

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

There are many versions of this copycat P.F. Changs lettuce wrap recipe on the internet, and this is my take on the popular dish. These lettuce wraps are healthy but more important than that- they are easy to make. Best of all, they are kid and adult-approved. I hope you enjoy this recipe our family loves.

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* [Sesame Oil](https://amzn.to/3b72o2v)

* Ground Beef: Lean ground beef is our preferred meat to use, but ground chicken or turkey would work fine. Whatever meat you use, be sure that it is finely minced; I use a [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/38BSlBY) to make my job easier. 

* Garlic 

* Ginger

* Scallions

* Soy Sauce 

* [Rice Wine Vinegar](https://amzn.to/3feHUZc) 

* Sriracha 

* Homemade Hoisin: While store-bought hoisin is super tasty, it is high in sugar content. If you're concerned about sugar like our family, I recommend making the homemade hoisin sauce suggested in the recipe. If you don't have the ingredients or the time to make your own, store-bought hoisin will be fine. 

* Butter Lettuce

* [Chili Oil](https://amzn.to/3piBFay)

* Peanuts

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* 2 small bowls
* 2 [skillets](https://amzn.to/3xyWEtj)
* A [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/38BSlBY)

#### Are these lettuce wraps keto? Are they low-carb?

Yes, all you have to do is remove the peanuts and use the homemade hoisin sauce with [monk fruit](https://amzn.to/3xWllzW) or preferred sweetener. We even calculated the macros to make it easier for you.

Macros for the Wraps: 
* CARBS– 2 Net Carbs
* PROTEIN– 23g
* FAT– 17g

Macros for the Hoisin Sauce: 
* CARBS– 1 Net Carb
* PROTEIN– 2g
* FAT– 6g 

#### Can I freeze ground beef?

You sure can. First, allow the meat to cool completely. Then, add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. To prevent freezer burn, you can layer plastic wrap over the dish before securing the lid. The beef mixture will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your lettuce and hoisin sauce.
