* 1 tsp Parsely, dried 

#### STOVE-TOP INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Preheat a [skillet](https://amzn.to/3lfBGLa) over medium-high heat.
2. Add the kielbasa to the heated pan. Stir regularly to prevent burning or sticking.
3. Once the kielbasa is cooked and heated through, set it aside. 
4. In the same [skillet](https://amzn.to/3lfBGLa), add the potatoes, season with salt and parsely, and then cook on medium heat for about 10-15 minutes. 
5. Next, add the peppers and reduce to low heat. Cook for another 10 minutes, and then return the kielbasa to the pan. 

#### OVEN INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and prepare a [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3I126tD). 
2. Slice the potatoes, keilbasa, and peppers. Spread the potatoes and keilbasa onto the [baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3I126tD). Season the potatoes with salt and parsely and set the peppers aside.
