### ABOUT THE MEAL

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Rice: Be sure to cook your rice ahead of time and place it in the refrigerator to chill. Chilled rice is necessary because it crisps up better when frying, and that is definitely what we want. Additionally, if you have leftover white rice in the refrigerator, this is a great way to repurpose it. 

* Vegetables: In this recipe, I only used onions, peas, and garlic. Normally I would add small carrots as well, but for some reason, my children have decided to have an aversion to them, so here we are. If you're a vegetable fan, consider adding corn, snow peas, and other vegetables to brighten the dish even more. 

* Eggs: It just would not be stir-fried rice without a bit of egg.  

* Butter: Yes, I use butter in my fried rice. Why? Because rice tastes better with butter in it. 

* Soy Sauce: If it's stir-fried rice, you've got to add soy sauce. 

* Oyster Sauce: This sauce adds a depth of flavor to the rice. The sweetness of the oyster sauce cuts the saltiness of the soy sauce and blends perfectly with the fat from the butter. 

* Sesame Oil: To be honest, this is my favorite addition to fried rice. I love adding it at the end because not only does it taste amazing, it smells absolutely delicious. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

#### Can I freeze fried rice?

You sure can. First, allow the rice to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag, careful to remove as much air as possible. The rice will freeze for up to 3 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, defrost the rice in the refrigerator overnight and warm it on the stove-top or in the microwave.
