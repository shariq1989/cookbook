### ABOUT THE MEAn

Need a late-night snack or a meal to please your kids? Try our stir-fried rice includes white rice, onions, peas, garlic, and scrambled eggs. This easy-to-make vegetable stir-fried rice packs so much flavor. You can make it from scratch or use leftover rice for a convenient meal on a busy night. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Rice: Cook your rice ahead of time and place it in the refrigerator to chill. Chilled rice crisps nicely and does not clump when frying. If you have leftover white rice in the fridge, this is a great way to repurpose it. 

* Vegetables: In this recipe, I used onions, peas, and garlic. Normally, I would also add small carrots, but my children have decided they are averse, so here we are. If you love vegetables, consider adding corn, snow peas, and other vegetables to change things up or to use up those you have on hand. 

* Eggs: It would not be stir-fried rice without a bit of egg.  

* Butter: Yes, I use butter in my fried rice. Why? Simply put, rice tastes better with butter in it. 

* Soy Sauce: It is stir-fried rice, so we had to add a little soy sauce. 

* Oyster Sauce: This sauce adds sweetness to the rice; it cuts the saltiness and blends perfectly with the fat from the butter. 

* Sesame Oil: To be honest, this is my favorite addition to fried rice. I love to add it at the end because not only does it taste amazing, it smells delicious. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large [saute pan](https://amzn.to/35LnBg1) or [wok](https://amzn.to/3cS6RI4)

#### Can I freeze fried rice?

You sure can. First, allow the rice to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag, careful to remove as much air as possible. The rice will freeze for up to 3 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, defrost the rice in the refrigerator overnight and warm it on the stove-top or in the microwave.
