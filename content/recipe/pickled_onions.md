#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Red Onion: I like pickled red onion, but use whatever onion variety you prefer. Just be sure to slice the onions thinly; this helps them maintain crispness. You want them to be no thicker than 1/4-inch.

#### Are pickled onions vegetarian? Are they vegan?

This recipe is naturally vegetarian. To make it vegan, use sugar or syrup to sweeten the mixture instead of honey.

After the onions have cooled, seal the mason jar and refrigerate it. The onions will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 weeks.
