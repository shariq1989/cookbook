#### THE STORY BEHIND THE MEAL 

There are so many versions of this recipe floating around the interweb and that makes sense. Zuppa Toscana is tasty! Honestly, that's all I ever ordered at Olive Garden, so instead of spending $10 for a soup, we decided to make our own. Here is our family's version; we hope you enjoy it.
