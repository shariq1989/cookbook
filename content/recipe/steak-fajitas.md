### How to Sheet-Pan Steak Fajitas 

#### Ingredients 

* 2 tbsp [Red Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3rYFwwm) 
* 1 tbsp [Smoked Paprika](https://amzn.to/3rSkTlo)
* 2 tsp [Mexican Oregano](https://amzn.to/31QEzuT), dried 
* 2 tsp Cumin, ground 
* 1 tsp Salt 
* 1 1/2 lb Sirloin, Skirt, or Flank Steak, cut into strips 
* 1/2 Red Bell Pepper, thinly sliced 
* 1/2 Yellow Bell Pepper, thinly sliced 
* 1/2 Yellow Onion, thinly sliced
* 2 tsp Avocado Oil 
* 3 Garlic Cloves, minced 
* 2 tbsp Lime Juice, about two limes
* [Liquid Smoke](https://amzn.to/3lZ9MDg), to taste 

#### Instructions 

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. 
2. In a small bowl, combine red chili powder, smoked paprika, oregano, cumin, and salt. Set aside. 
3. Add steak, bell pepper, onion, avocado oil, garlic, and lime juice to a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3GyRC3c), and incorporate well. Pour the reserved spice mixture over the top, and stir to combine. 
4. Spread the seasoned mixture onto a [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/339IQqI). Bake for 15 minutes. 
5. Remove the fajitas from the oven and lightly season with liquid smoke, to taste. Stir and return the [baking sheet](https://amzn.to/339IQqI) to the oven for another 10 minutes. 
6. If you enjoy a little char on your fajitas (because I do), broil for 3-5 minutes to finish. 
7. Garnish your fajitas with sour cream, [guacamole]({{< ref "guacamole" >}}), shredded cheese, and fresh lime. Serve with corn or flour tortillas, and complete the meal with our favorite [Mexican rice]({{< ref "Mexican-rice" >}}) recipe.
