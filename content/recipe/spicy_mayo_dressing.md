#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Mayonnaise: We live in North Carolina now so [Dukes](https://amzn.to/3i8LkxD) is the only choice. 
* [Sriracha](https://amzn.to/3m6bmmm): My family loves Sriracha, but if for some reason you do not, use hot sauce or [sambal oelek](https://amzn.to/3zGtgAQ) in place of Sriracha in the spicy mayo dressing. 
* Pickle Juice: You can use any pickle juice, but I happen to be picky about my pickles and the juice they come in. You won't regret choosing the pickles in the deli section of your grocery store. I prefer Grillos Pickles.
* White Onion
