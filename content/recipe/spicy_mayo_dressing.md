### ABOUT THE DRESSING

Bring your salad, burger, chicken breast, or sandwich to another level using this spicy mayo dressing. 

#### What is in Spicy Mayo Dressing? 

* Mayonnaise: We live in North Carolina now, so [Dukes](https://amzn.to/3i8LkxD) is the only choice. 

* [Sriracha](https://amzn.to/3m6bmmm): My family loves Sriracha. If for some reason you do not, use hot sauce or [sambal oelek](https://amzn.to/3zGtgAQ) in place of Sriracha. 

* Pickle Juice: You can use any pickle juice, but I am selective about my pickles and the juice they come in. You won't regret choosing pickles from the deli section of your grocery store. I like Grillos Pickles if you can find them. 

* White Onion

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?
