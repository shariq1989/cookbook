### How to Make Channa Masala 

#### Ingredients  

* 2 tbsp [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW) 
* 1 tsp [Kolongi Seeds](https://amzn.to/3jMZUuh), plus more for garnish
* 1 tsp [Cumin Seeds](https://amzn.to/3vBeR8i)
* 1-3 Thai Green Chili, split lengthwise 
* 1 Red Onion, finely chopped
* 3 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 1-inch fresh Ginger, minced 
* 1-2 tsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC)
* 1 tsp [Turmeric Powder](https://amzn.to/3vyvAZK)
* 1 tsp Homemade [Garam Masala]({{< ref "garam-masala" >}})
* 1 tsp [Coriander](https://amzn.to/3lwbJ92), ground 
* 1-2 large Tomatoes, chopped, use more if you prefer to have more gravy
* 2- 15 oz can Chickpeas, drained and rinsed 
* 1/2 cup Cilantro, chopped, plus more to garnish 
* 1/2 cup Water 
* Salt, to taste

#### Channa Masala Stove-Top Instructions 

1. Heat the ghee in a [heavy-bottomed pan](https://amzn.to/3F0cvEn) over medium-high heat. Add 1 tsp of kalonji seeds, cumin seed, and green chilies. Cook until the ingredients begin to sputter.
2. Lower the heat to medium-low, and then add the onion. Cook until the onions brown and caramelize. This step may take a while, and that’s okay. You are building flavor. 
3. Next, add garlic and ginger, and stir to combine.
4. In a small bowl, combine chili powder, turmeric, and garam masala. Stir the spices into the mixture until it becomes fragrant, about 30 seconds.
5. Add tomatoes and simmer for 5 minutes.
6. Remove the green chilies and set them aside. Remove the mixture from heat and add it to a blender or [food processor](https://amzn.to/3o68l64). Blend until smooth. You can also use an [immersion blender](https://amzn.to/3pcRrDQ) for this step.
7. Return the mixture to the [pan](https://amzn.to/3F0cvEn), along with the reserved chilies. Then add the chickpeas, cilantro, 1/2 cup water, and bring it all to a simmer.
8. Sprinkle the dish with kalonji seeds and cover the pan with the lid slightly ajar. Lower the heat and maintain a gentle bubble. Cook for about 12-15 minutes until the mixture reduces.
9. Season the channa masala with salt and garnish with cilantro to serve.
 

#### Channa Masala Instant Pot Instructions  

1. Heat the ghee in an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3ttlual) on saute mode. Add 1 tsp of kalonji seeds, cumin seed, and green chilies. Cook until the ingredients begin to sputter.
2. Add the onion. Cook until the onions brown and caramelize. This step may take a while, and that’s okay. You are building flavor. 
3. Next, add garlic and ginger, and stir to combine.
4. In a small bowl, combine chili powder, turmeric, and garam masala. Stir the spices into the mixture until it becomes fragrant, about 30 seconds.
5. Add tomatoes and simmer for 5 minutes.
6. Remove the green chilies and set them aside. Remove the mixture from heat and add it to a blender or [food processor](https://amzn.to/3o68l64). Blend until smooth. You can also use an [immersion blender](https://amzn.to/3pcRrDQ) for this step.
7. Return the mixture to the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3ttlual), along with the reserved chilies. Then add the chickpeas, cilantro, 1/2 cup water, and bring it all to a simmer on saute mode.

### About the Meal 

Like many popular dishes in Indian and Pakistan, recipes for chana masala or channa masala vary from region to region. This channa masala recipe is similar to those found in Northern India and Pakistan. I hope you enjoy this recipe our family loves.

#### Chana Masala Ingredients:

* [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW) 

* [Kolongi Seeds](https://amzn.to/3jMZUuh)

* [Cumin Seeds](https://amzn.to/3vBeR8i)

* Thai Green Chili

* Red Onion

* Garlic 

* Ginger

* Spices: I used [kashmiri chili powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC), [turmeric powder](https://amzn.to/3vyvAZK), homemade [garam masala]({{< ref "garam-masala" >}}), and [coriander powder](https://amzn.to/3lwbJ92) to flavor the channa. 

* Tomato

* Chickpeas: We used canned simply out of convenience, but you can also use dry chickpeas. If you go that route, you will need to soak the chickpeas for 6-24 hours and increase the cooking time for this recipe, about 1-2 hours.

* Cilantro

* Salt

* Garam Masala: India is a large country with varying sub-cultures. As a result, Indian food differs from region to region. The same thing applies to specific spices used as well. For this reason, I suggest making garam masala at home, so you can control the amount of each spice used and cater it specifically to your preferences. Here is one of the [garam masala]({{< ref "garam-masala" >}}) spice blends we use in our home. If you choose store-bought, I suggest [Rani](https://amzn.to/3m1KWBX) garam masala.

#### What equipment is needed to make this recipe?

* A [heavy-bottomed pan](https://amzn.to/3F0cvEn) with a lid or an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3ttlual)
* A small bowl
* A [food processor](https://amzn.to/3o68l64), [blender](https://amzn.to/2SrI06u), or an [immersion blender](https://amzn.to/3pcRrDQ)

#### Can I modify this recipe to make it vegan?

To make vegan channa masala use a different oil in place of the ghee. I suggest [grapeseed oil](https://amzn.to/3cLwWYG).

#### What can I serve with channa masala? 

Roti, [paratha]({{< ref "paratha" >}}), poori or puri, chapati, or basmati rice are the most popular. 

#### Can I freeze channa masala? 

You sure can. First, allow the dish to cool, and add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. Channa masala will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stovetop, and enjoy. 

#### Other variations of channa masala? 

* Black Channa Masala or Kala Channa Masala  
* Aloo Channa Masala 
* Punjabi Channa Masala 
* White Channa Masala, Kabuli Channa Masala, Chole Channa 
* Pindi Channa Masala  
* Channa Subji
