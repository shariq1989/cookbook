If you're concerned about carbohydrates Peruvian, chicken is a perfect keto or low-carb meal.

### About the Meal 

This Peruvian chicken recipe is butterflied and roasted whole in the oven. We serve our chicken with our take on the delicious Peruvian green sauce or serrano crema. I hope you enjoy this meal our family loves.

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Chicken: I used a whole, butterflied, or spatchcocked chicken for this recipe because, in my opinion, that is the tastiest and most effective way to make a chicken. Spatchcocking a chicken describes cutting the backbone out of the chicken and flattening it; this allows the chicken to roast evenly. You can also use the same rub and recipe to make chicken thighs, legs, or a combination of the two. I wouldn't recommend using chicken breast because they are more likely to come out dry if cooked alone. Reminder, the safe cooking temperature for chicken is 165 degrees.

Peruvian Chicken Marinade: I used a combination of [cumin](https://amzn.to/3eebpcJ), paprika, kosher salt, black pepper, garlic, distilled white vinegar, and olive oil to flavor the chicken.  

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3bE8h90)

* A [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/339IQqI)

* A small bowl

* A [food thermometer](https://amzn.to/2RnEB8c)

#### Is Peruvian chicken keto? Is it low-carb?

Yes, it is. I even calculated the macros to make it easy for you. The serving size for these macros is 5 ounces of chicken. 

* CARBS – 2 Net Carbs 
* PROTEIN – 27g
* FAT – 10g

To finish your low-carb meal, I recommend serving keto, Peruvian chicken with cauliflower rice and a side of [serrano crema](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/serrano-crema/).
