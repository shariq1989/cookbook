Servings: 5 <!--more-->

Cooking Time: 1 hour 

Cuisine: Sicilian 

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 10-15 [Jumbo Pasta Shells](https://amzn.to/3rUskFr), cooked al dente, according to the package
* 1/2 cup Basil Pesto Sauce, plus more to garnish
* 1 tsp Olive Oil
* 2 cups Spinach, steamed and wilted
* 15 oz package Ricotta Cheese
* 1 Egg
* 3-5 Garlic Cloves, minced
* Black Pepper, coarse ground, to taste
* 1/2 cup Parmesan Cheese, shredded, plus more to garnish
* 1 cup Fresh Basil
* 2 tbsp [Pine Nuts](https://amzn.to/3amamWp), toasted 

#### INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Cook the pasta shells, al dente, according to the package, and strain. Set them aside. 
2. In a small skillet, saute the spinach with 1 tsp of olive oil until wilted. Set aside. 
3. Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees. 
4. In a large bowl, mix the ricotta cheese and egg. Then, stir in the minced garlic, wilted spinach, and parmesan cheese. Season the mixture with pepper.
5. Prepare a 9 x 10 baking dish with olive oil and layer some of the basil pesto sauce along the bottom of the dish. 
6. Divide the cheese mixture into the cooked pasta shells; fill each shell with 2 tbsp of the cheese mixture. 
7. Line the shells in the baking dish, facing upright, so the filling will not spill into the pan. 
8. Drizzle more basil pesto sauce on top and then sprinkle with parmesan cheese. 
9. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 50 minutes. 
10. Remove the foil and cook for another 5-8 minutes. If your cheese hasn't begun to brown, you can broil for 1-2 minutes to achieve the desired effect. 

### ABOUT THE MEAL

#### Where do stuffed shells originate? 

Stuffed shells find their origin in Sicily, but they remain popular worldwide. For this recipe, we chose to stray from the traditional stuffed shell made in marinara sauce in favor of shells stuffed to the brim with ricotta cheese and spinach and topped with basil pesto and pine nuts. I appreciate the classic stuffed shells, but this version is tasty if you wanted to try something new. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Jumbo Pasta Shells: Be sure to cook the shells, al dente, according to the package. I suggest cooking them a little less to ensure they hold up during the stuffing and baking process.  

* Ricotta Cheese: This light and creamy cheese contribute to the savoriness of the meal. To avoid a watery filling, drain the ricotta cheese before using it. If necessary, spread it onto a baking sheet and dab it with a paper towel to soak up any excess moisture. 

* Basil Pesto Sauce: I am sure there are many variations of this sauce, but I love, love, love the Kirkland brand at Costco. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A sauce pan 
* A small skillet 
* A large bowl 
* A 9 x 13 [baking dish](https://amzn.to/3bNst8g)

#### Are stuffed shells vegetarian? Are stuffed shells vegan? 

While the stuffed shells are vegetarian, this recipe does not cater to the vegan diet. 

#### Can I freeze my leftover stuffed shells? 

Yep! First, allow the shells to cool completely and then cover them in saran wrap, followed by aluminum foil. Then place them in a freezer-safe bag or container. Stuffed shells will freeze for up to 3 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, defrost the shells in the refrigerator overnight and bake the shells from frozen. Add 30 minutes to the original baking time to ensure the shells are heated through.
