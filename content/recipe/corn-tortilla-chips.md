### How to Make Corn Tortilla Chips 

#### Ingredients 

* 2 cups Coconut Oil 
* 12 Corn Tortillas, cut into six wedges 
* Kosher Salt, to taste
  
#### Stove-Top Instructions: Fried Corn Tortilla Chips

1. Gather the corn tortillas and cut them into six wedges. Set aside. 
2. Set a [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3bc4gbc) into a [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/2QTLqyJ). I cover the baking sheet with a cloth or parchment paper for easy cleanup. 
3. Add coconut oil to a [skillet](https://amzn.to/3xyYslO), about 1/4-inches deep. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it begins to smoke. Then reduce the heat to medium to prevent burning. You will have to adjust the heat back and forth throughout this process. 
4. Add the tortillas in a single layer to the oil without overlapping. Fry for 1 minute and flip, and then fry for another minute until the tortillas are lightly golden and crisp.
5. With a pair of tongs, remove the tortilla chips and place them onto the [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3bc4gbc) to drain. Sprinkle evenly with Kosher salt while they are still hot. When the chips have had an opportunity to drain, add them to a [serving bowl](https://amzn.to/3euX5Ng) to make room for the other chips on the wire rack.
6. Repeat with the remaining tortilla chips until all have had a chance to fry.

#### Oven Instructions: Baked Corn Tortilla Chips 

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 
2. Prepare two [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/2QTLqyJ).
3. Gather the corn tortillas and brush both sides of each tortilla with coconut oil. Then, stack the tortillas cut them into six wedges. Set aside. 
4. Add the tortillas in a single layer onto the prepared [baking sheets](https://amzn.to/2QTLqyJ). 
5. Cook the chips for 7-10 minutes. Then, rotate the pans and continue cooking them for another 7-10 minutes. 
6. While the tortillas are still piping hot, sprinkle them with salt, and then set them aside to cool.

### About the Chips 

Have you ever eaten chips in a restaurant and wondered why they are so much better than store-bought chips? We've got you covered; these made-from-scratch corn tortillas taste just like what you would get in a restaurant. Seriously, if forced to eat one food for the rest of my life, chips and salsa would be it, specifically with these chips. They are a favorite in our home, and it's not just of mine; our children love them also. Enjoy these tortilla chips from corn tortillas with our [homemade salsa with cilantro and avocado]({{< ref "salsa-cilantro-avocado" >}}), or [guacamole]({{< ref "guacamole" >}}). You could also make dessert nachos dusted with sugar and cinnamon and topped with fruit and whipped cream. 

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Corn Tortillas: Our family loves corn tortilla chips; you could use blue corn or flour tortillas instead. 

* Coconut Oil: I love the added flavor of coconut oil, but use your preferred oil. However,  choose an oil with a high smoke point since you are frying the tortillas. I suggest using avocado oil or vegetable oil. You can also use canola oil, grapeseed oil, or sunflower oil.

* Salt: I use Kosher salt because that is something I always have in my pantry; sea salt is a great alternative. Both will give you the restaurant-quality salt experience we know and love. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* 1-2 [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/2QTLqyJ)
* A [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3bc4gbc)
* A [skillet](https://amzn.to/3xyYslO)
* A [serving bowl](https://amzn.to/3euX5Ng)

#### What are some other ways to flavor the chips? 

* [Tajin](https://amzn.to/2Srx09c): I am from Arizona, so this blend is a staple in our pantry. The chili-lime flavor of Tajin tastes great on tortilla chips.  

* Lime: Add the zest and juice of a lime over the chips and toss for a citrus tang.

* Sweets: Want something a little adventurous? Try dessert nachos using the same tortilla chips found in this recipe. Juts add, cinnamon and sugar in place of salt, and then top the chips with fruit and whipped cream. 

#### What is the best way to store leftover chips? 

Should you have leftovers, these chips store well in a paper bag or an airtight container on your countertop. They will last for up to one week, but I highly recommend eating them the same day for the best results.
