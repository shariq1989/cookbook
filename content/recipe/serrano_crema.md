### ABOUT THE MEAL

I made this serrano chili crema as a side for our  [Peruvian Chicken](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/peruvian_chicken/). However, I quickly realized it pairs well with other roasted chicken recipes as well. It makes for a spicy salad dressing and can even act as a nice serrano sauce for tacos or chickpea entrees.

#### Serrano Crema Ingredients: 

* Serrano Chili: I prefer the flavor and heat from serrano chillies, but the use of this chili creates a spicy serrano crema that may be too hot for some. If you're looking for a milder sauce, use jalapenos instead. 

* Yogurt

* Sour Cream 

* Lime 

* Olive Oil

#### What other ingredients could I add to the crema? 
Avocado would make for a creamy addition to the crema; you could even call it avocado serrano crema. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [food processor](https://amzn.to/3vE4gs7) or [blender](https://amzn.to/2RqFDQM) 

#### Is serrano crema spicy? 
The use of serrano chillies may be too hot for some. If you're looking for a milder sauce, use jalapeno chillies instead.
