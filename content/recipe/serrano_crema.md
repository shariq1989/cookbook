### ABOUT THE MEAL

I made this Serrano Crema as a side for our [Peruvian Chicken](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/peruvian_chicken/). I quickly realized, however, that it pairs well with other roasted chicken entrees and as a topping for chickpea dishes as well. It makes for a tasty salad dressing and can even act as a serrano sauce for tacos. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Serrano Chili: I prefer the flavor and heat of the serrano chili in general, but the use of this chili creates a spicy serrano crema that may be too hot for some. If you're looking for a more mild sauce, use jalapenos instead. 

* Yogurt

* Sour Cream 

* Lime 

* Olive Oil

* Cilantro 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [food processor](https://amzn.to/3vE4gs7) or [blender](https://amzn.to/2RqFDQM) 

#### What other ingredients could I add to this crema? 

To add some variety to your rotation, you could add other ingredients like cilantro or avocado to your the serrano crema.
