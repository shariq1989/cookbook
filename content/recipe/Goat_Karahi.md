Servings: 3-4 <!--more-->

#### INGREDIENTS 
* 1/2 cup Ghee, divided
* 1 1/2 lb Goat, bone- in, cut into 1 to 2-inch pieces
* 1/2 medium Yellow Onion, chopped
* 4-5 medium Tomatoes, pureed in a blender
* 2 tsp Ginger Paste
* 2 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 1/2 Package Laziza Karahi Masala 
* 1 tsp Kashmiri Chili Powder
* 1 tsp Kalonji Seeds 
* 2 Green Chilis, split lengthwise
* 1 cup Cilantro, chopped, divided, for garnish 
* 1/4 cup Fresh Ginger, cut into sticks, for garnish

#### DIRECTIONS 

1.In a heavy-bottomed pan warm the ghee over low heat.
2. Add the onion, stirring frequently, until onions become soft and brown (not burned or charred). This step can take a while, thatâ€™s okay.
3. Add the tomatoes and the onion mixture to the food processer and blend until smooth. Set aside.
4. Return pan used for the onions to medium-high heat, along with the remaining ghee.
5. Add the goat and fry, stirring constantly until color begins to change.
6. Add ginger paste and garlic, stirring constantly so nothing burns, about 2 minutes.
7. Stir in the pureed tomato and onion mixture, masala, Kashmiri chili powder, kalonji seeds, 1/3 cup cilantro, and green chilis. Cover the pan and set the heat to low.
8. Let karahi cook for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally to ensure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan. Check the goat for tenderness (attempt to separate the meat from the bone using a fork. Meat should easily pull). If not, allow the meat to simmer longer until it has reached desired tenderness.
9. Garnish with ginger sticks, cilantro, and extra green chilis.
10. Serve with naan or long-grain basmati rice.


#### THE STORY BEHIND THE MEAL 

Before meeting Shariq, I (Tressa) had no experience with eating or making Desi food. If you asked me the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry I couldn't have told you. I am incredibly honored to be able to study Desi cooking under my mother-in-law, who is a phenomenal cook. She cooks off-script so you have to observe as she buzzes through the kitchen or you miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build upon flavors to create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by her cooking, though I am sure hers would be even tastier.
