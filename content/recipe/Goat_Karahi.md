Servings: 3-4 <!--more-->

#### INGREDIENTS 
* 1/2 cup Ghee, divided
* 1 1/2 lb Goat, bone- in, cut into 1 to 2-inch pieces
* 1/2 medium Yellow Onion, chopped
* 4-5 medium Tomatoes, pureed in a blender
* 2 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 1/2 Package Laziza Karahi Masala 
* 1 tsp Kashmiri Chili Powder
* 1 tsp Kalonji Seeds (black seed)
* 2 Green Chilis, split lengthwise
* 1 cup Cilantro, chopped, divided, for garnish 
* 1/4 cup Fresh Ginger, julienne, for garnish

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Warm Ghee in a heavy bottomed pan on a low heat. 
2. Add onion, stirring frequently, until onions become soft and brown in color (not burned or charred). 
3. Combine onions and the tomatoes in a food processer until smooth. Set aside. 
4. Return pan used for the onions to a medium-high heat, along with the remaining ghee. 
5. Add goat and fry, stirring constantly until color begins to change.
6. Add ginger and garlic, stirring constantly so nothing burns, about 3 minutes.
7. Stir in the tomato and onion mixture, masala, Kashmiri chili powder, kalongi seeds, 1/3 cup cilantro, and green chilis. Cover the pan and set the heat to low.  
8. Let it cook for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally to ensure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan. Check the goat for tenderness (attempt to seperate the meat from the bone using a fork. Meat should easily pull). If not, allow the meat to simmer longer until it has reached the desired tenderness.  
9. Garnish with ginger, cilantro, and extra green chilis. Serve with naan or basmati rice.
