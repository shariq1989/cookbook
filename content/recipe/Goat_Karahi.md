Servings: 3-4 <!--more-->

#### INGREDIENTS 
* 1/2 cup Ghee, divided
* 1 1/2 lb Goat, bone- in, cut in 1 to 2-inch pieces
* 1/2 medium Yellow Onion, chopped
* 4-5 medium Tomatoes, pureed in a blender
* 2 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 1/2 Package Laziza Karahi Masala 
* 1 tsp Red Chili Powder (not American red chili powder) 
* 1 tsp Kalonji Seeds (black seed)
* 2 Green Chilis, split
* 1 cup Cilantro, chopped, divided, for garnish 
* 1/4 cup Fresh Ginger, julienne, for garnish

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Warm Ghee in a thick, heavy pan on low heat. 
2. Add onion, stirring frequently, until onions become soft and brown in color (not burned or charred). 
3. Combine onions and tomatoes in a food processer until smooth. Set aside. 
4. Return pan used for onions to a medium-high heat, along with the remaining ghee. 
5. Add goat and fry, stirring constantly until color begins to change.
6. Add the ginger and garlic, stirring constantly so nothing burns, about 3 minutes.
7. Stir in the tomato and onion mixture, masala, chili powder, kalongi seeds, 1/3 cup cilantro, and green chilis. Cover the pan and set the heat to low.  
8. Let simmer and cook for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally to ensure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan. Check goat for tenderness (use a fork to see if meat will pull from the bone). If not, allow the meat to simmer longer.  
9. Garnish with ginger, cilantro, and extra green chilis. Serve with naan or basmati rice.
