### ABOUT THIS DESSERT

I’ve always loved cooking and baking, but I haven’t always been great at it- especially baking. With the success of my [nutella cookies](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/nutella_cookies/), I was on a mission to bake the perfect chocolate chip cookie. Well, here it is, folks. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

Butter: I use two sticks of butter in this recipe, and what I am about to tell you is the key for high-elevation cookies that do not cave in. Before you begin, allow the butter to reach room temperature. Do not, I repeat, do not melt the butter. 

Baking Soda: Baking soda is a necessary ingredient for many chocolate chip cookie recipes, but in this one, we have you dissolve it in hot water.  Why? I use the hot water to ensure the baking soda fully dissolves; this extra step ensures even distribution of the baking soda throughout the mixture.

All-Purpose Flour 

Sugar: I use white and brown sugar for this recipe. 

Chocolate Chips

#### Can I freeze the cookie dough?
Yes, roll the dough into one large ball and place it into a freezer-safe bag. Clear any air out of the bag before securing it. The cookie dough will keep for three months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, follow the baking instructions for this recipe.
