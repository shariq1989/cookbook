### ABOUT THIS DESSERT

I’ve always loved cooking and baking, but I haven’t always been great at it, especially baking. With the success of my [nutella cookies](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/nutella_cookies/), I was on a mission to bake the perfect chocolate chip cookie. Well, here it is, folks. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

Butter: We use 2 sticks of butter in this recipe; this thing I am about to tell you is the key for high elevation cookies that don't cave in. Before you begin, allow your butter to reach room temperature. Do not, I repeat, do not melt the butter. 

Baking Soda: Baking soda is a key ingredient for many chocolate chip cookie recipes, but in this one, we have you dissolve it in hot water, why? Essentially you are using the hot water to ensure that the baking soda is entirely dissolved. This extra step is helpful because it makes for a more even distribution throughout the mixture.

Flour 

Sugar: We use granulated white sugar and brown sugar for this recipe. 

Chocolate Chips

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large bowl
* A [hand-mixer](https://amzn.to/3rRtUs2)
* A baking sheet. I use the stones from Pampered Chef. 

#### Can I freeze the dough?
Yes, roll the dough into one large ball and place it into a Ziploc bag. Clear any air out of the bag before securing it. The cookie dough will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, follow the baking instructions for this recipe.
