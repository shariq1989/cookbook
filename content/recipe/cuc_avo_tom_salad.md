### ABOUT THE SALAD

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Cocktail Cucumbers: You can also cube regular cucumbers for this salad, but our family loves the cocktail cucumbers. I personally think they are crisper than the regular ones, and I love the crunch they add to any salad. 

* Avocado 

* Tomatoes

* Olive Oil and Lime 

* Spices: I stuck with the dynamic duo and simply falvored the salad with Kosher salt and coarse ground pepper.
