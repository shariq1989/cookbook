#### Instant Pot Instructions 

1. Set an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) to saute mode and warm the ghee. 
2. Add the boriya chili, cumin seed, mustard seed, and curry leaves. Cook until the ingredients begin to sputter. 
3. Next, add onion and green chillies. Fry until the onions brown and caramelize. Reserve half of the onion mixture and set aside at room temperature. 
4. Add the ginger, garlic, turmeric, chili powder, and [Garam Masala]({{< ref "garam-masala" >}}/) to the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ), give it a quick stir, and then add the tomatoes. Let the mixture simmer for about 2 minutes.

6. Secure the lid, set the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) to manual high pressure, and cook for 20 minutes. Allow the Instant Pot to release naturally for 5 minutes, and then do a quick release. 
7. Stir the dal to check the consistency. If it is thicker than desired, add 1/2 cup HOT water before serving. 
8. Garnish with the reserved onion mixture, cilantro, and extra green chillies. Serve with long-grained Basmati rice.

#### Is moong dal vegan? 

With one substitution, yes it is. Fry the onions in vegetable oil instead of ghee. 

#### Can I freeze dal? 

Yes it is. Allow the Moong Dal to cool and prepare several freezer-safe bags or containers. Scoop a small amount of dal into each one, making sure to leave a few inches of space so the dal can expand if needed. Moong Dal will freeze for up to 2 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your sides.
