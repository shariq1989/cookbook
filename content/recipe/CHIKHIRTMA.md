Servings: 2 Loaves <!--more-->

#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Broth: 

* 1 Bunch Cilantro 
* 1 Bunch Dill 
* 1 Garlic Head 
* 2 1/2 - 3 LBS. Bone-in, Skin-on Chicken 
* 10 CUPS of Water 
* 1 Large Onion, quartered 
* 2 TSP. Kosher Salt 
* 1 TSP. Peppercorns 
* ½ TSP. Coriander Seeds 
* ½ TSP. Red Pepper Flakes 
* 1 Cinnamon Stick 
* 2 Bay Leaves 

For the Soup: 

* 5 Medium Carrots 
* 1 Large Onion, Finely Diced 
* 3 TBSP. Salted Butter 
* ½ TSP. Kosher Salt*  
* ½ Dry Vermouth 
* 1 TBSP. Flour 
* 6 Large Egg Yolks 
* ½ CUP Lemon Juice (1-2 Lemons) 
* Ground Black Pepper 


#### DIRECTIONS 

To Make the Broth: 

1. Tie the stems of the cilantro and dill bundles, then trim the leaves, reserving ¼ CUP of each for garnish. Cut off and discard the top third of the garlic head, leaving the head intact. 
2. In a large pot, combine the stems, garlic, chicken and remaining broth ingredients. Bring to a boil and then reduce to medium-low. Simmer until chicken is tender, about 45 minutes.
3. Remove and set aside the garlic head. 
4. Transfer the chicken to a plate and cool. Shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces, discarding the skin, bones and cartilage. 

To Make the Soup: 

1. Strain the broth into another pot, discarding the solid. Using tongs, squeeze the garlic head into the broth; the tender cloves should pop out of their skins. Whisk into the broth. 
2. Wipe out the empty pot, then add butter, carrots, onions, and salt. Set over medium heat and cook, stir occasionally, until the onion is browned, 10-12 minutes. Add the vermouth, scraping up the brown bits and cook until evaporated, 1-2 minutes. 
3. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly for 1 minute. 
4. Add 2 CUPS of broth and stir until smooth, then add the remaining broth and bring to a simmer. 
5. In a medium bowl, whisk the yolks. Continue whisking while slowly adding 1 CUP of hot broth from the pot. Whisk in the lemon juice, then return the mixture to the pot and whisk to combine. 
6. Add the chicken and any accumulated juices and cook until just heated through (do not simmer once the eggs are in the mixture). Taste and season with salt and pepper.
7. Serve with the reserved cilantro and dill as garnish.
