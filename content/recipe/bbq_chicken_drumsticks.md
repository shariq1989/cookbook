#### OVEN INSTRUCTIONS

Cooking Time: 40 minutes 

1. In a large bowl, mix the spices for the rub and massage them into the drumsticks. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 6 hours.
2. Preheat the grill by setting all burners to high heat for about 10 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and then set a wire rack into a rimmed baking sheet; line the drumsticks onto it.
4. Cook for 25-30 minutes, flipping the drumsticks halfway through.
5. Brush the drumsticks with bbq sauce and cook them for 3 minutes, sauce side down.

#### GRILL INSTRUCTION 

Cooking Time: 1 hour, 10 minutes

1. In a large bowl, mix the spices for the rub and massage them into the drumsticks. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 6 hours.
2. Preheat the grill by setting all burners to high heat for about 10 minutes.
3. Turn off the rightmost burner, but maintain a grill temperature of 350 degrees. Adjust the temperature accordingly.

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

We love get-togethers with family and friends; these BBQ chicken drumsticks are a perfect addition to any cookout, picnic, or backyard gathering. 

Also, you may be looking at the cooking time for this recipe and asking, why? Do I really have to cook the drumsticks that long? Trust me, using indirect heat while grilling yields the best results every time. The chicken will come out moist and cooked perfectly on the inside while still having the blistered outside you expect when eating BBQ drumsticks. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken Drumsticks: You can obviously grill any part of the chicken, but I love barbequing drumsticks. They are easy to eat and universally well-liked. Bonus, our kids devour them. 

* BBQ Sauce: I am sure there are many tasty BBQ sauces out there I don't know about, but our family go-to is [Sweet Baby Ray's](https://amzn.to/2NsxauJ). This brand is always delicious, and they offer [sugar-free](https://amzn.to/2MYvhWR), which makes everyone in the family happy. 

* BBQ Rub: You can use your favorite rub, but I prefer the homemade rub used in this recipe. Oftentimes, I double or triple the batch and put it in an airtight container to have some on hand. The rub will keep for up to 3 months. If you choose to go the store-bought route, we suggest using [Montreal's](https://amzn.to/2QOX1P8) mixed with a little brown sugar, about 2 tbsp.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large bowl 

* A baking sheet: Use the baking sheet to transport the cooked chicken to the kitchen. 

* A baking rimmed baking sheet and a wire rack

#### Are BBQ chicken drumsticks keto? Are they low-carb?

They are, substitute with sugar-free [bbq sauce](https://amzn.to/2MYvhWR) of your choice and replace the brown sugar in the rub with [Swerve](https://amzn.to/39rvQQS) brown sugar replacement. I calculated one serving of the BBQ drumsticks to make it easy for you. The serving size for the chicken is two drumsticks. 

For Chicken with the Rub (Swerve replacement included): 

* CARBS– 1 Net Carb
* PROTEIN– 55g
* FAT– 13g

For the BBQ Sauce- 2 tbsp: 

* CARBS– 1 Net Carb 

#### Can I freeze drumsticks?

Yes, first allow the drumsticks to cool completely, wrap them in aluminum foil, and add them to a freezer-safe container or Ziploc bag. The BBQ drumsticks will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm them in the oven or microwave.
