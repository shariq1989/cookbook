#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Rub: 

* 2 tbsp Brown Sugar
* 1 tbsp Paprika
* 1 tbsp Red Chili Powder
* 2 tsp Garlic Powder
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 1/2 tsp Pepper
* 1/4 tsp Cayenne Pepper

For the Chicken: 

* 8 Chicken Drumsticks, skin on, and bone-in
* BBQ Sauce of your choice, we like [Sweet Baby Rays](https://amzn.to/2NsxauJ) or the [sugar-free](https://amzn.to/2MYvhWR) version

#### INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a large bowl, mix the spices for the rub and massage them into the drumsticks. Cover and let the meat marinate in the fridge for 6 hours.
2. Preheat the grill by setting all burners to high, about 15 minutes.
3. Turn off the rightmost burner, but still maintain a grill temperature of 325-350 degrees.
4. Oil the grates and cook the drumsticks on the hottest side of the grill, skin-down. Cook until they become blistered, about 5 minutes.
5. Flip the drumsticks and cook for another 5 minutes.
6. Move the drumsticks to the cool side of the grill (rightmost burner that you turned off) and cook the skin-side up for 25 minutes.
7. Flip the drumsticks and continue cooking until the chicken has reached over 170 degrees, about 20-30 minutes. 
8. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes before serving.

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

We love get-togethers with family and friends; these BBQ chicken drumsticks are the perfect addition to any cookout, picnic, or backyard gathering. 

#### What main ingredients do you need for this meal?

* Chicken Drumsticks: You can grill any part of the chicken with BBQ sauce, but I love barbequing drumsticks. They are easy to eat and universally well-liked. Bonus, our kids devour them. 

* BBQ Sauce: I am sure there are many tasty BBQ sauces out there I don't know about, but our family go-to is [Sweet Baby Ray's](https://amzn.to/2NsxauJ). This brand is always delicious, and they offer [sugar-free](https://amzn.to/2MYvhWR), which makes everyone in the family happy. 

* BBQ Rub: You can use your favorite rub, but we like our homemade used in this recipe. If you choose to go the store-bought route, we suggest using [Montreal's](https://amzn.to/2QOX1P8).

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large bowl 

* 2 baking sheets: Use the baking sheets to transport the marinated chicken and the cooked chicken back and forth between the grill and the kitchen.

#### Are these BBQ chicken drumsticks keto? Are they low-carb?

They are, as long as you use sugar-free barbeque sauce and replace the brown sugar in the rub with [Swerve](https://amzn.to/39rvQQS) brown sugar replacement. I even calculated the macros for you to make it easier.

#### Can I freeze the BBQ Drumsticks?

Yes, first allow the drumsticks to cool completely, wrap them in aluminum foil, and add them to a freezer-safe container or Ziploc bag. The BBQ drumsticks will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm them in the oven or microwave.
