Preparation Time: 6 hours, 20 minutes

Cooking Time: 1 hour 30 minutes

Cuisine: American

#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Rub: 

* 2 tbsp Brown Sugar
* 1 tbsp Paprika
* 1 tbsp Red Chili Powder
* 2 tsp Garlic Powder
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 1/2 tsp Pepper
* 1/4 tsp Cayenne Pepper

For the Chicken: 

* 8 Chicken Drumsticks, skin on, and bone-in
* BBQ Sauce of your choice, we like [Sweet Baby Rays](https://amzn.to/2NsxauJ) or the [sugar-free](https://amzn.to/2MYvhWR) version

#### INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a large bowl, mix the spices for the rub and massage them into the drumsticks. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 6 hours.
2. Preheat the grill by setting all burners to high heat for about 10 minutes.
3. Turn off the rightmost burner, but maintain a grill temperature of 350 degrees. Adjust the temperature accordingly.
4. Oil the grates and cook the drumsticks on the hottest side of the grill. Cook until they become blistered, about 5 minutes. I check them halfway through to prevent burning. 
5. Flip the drumsticks and cook for another 5 minutes to establish blistering on the other side. Again, check them halfway through. 
6. Move the drumsticks to the cool side of the grill, the rightmost burner you turned off, and cook them for 25 minutes. Check throughout to make sure the grill maintains a temperature of 350 degrees. 
7. Flip the drumsticks; continue cooking until the chicken has reached over 170 degrees, 20-30 minutes.
8. Brush the drumsticks with bbq sauce and move them, sauce side down, to the hot side of the grill; cook for 1 minute. 
9. Brush the other side with bbq sauce, and cook on that side for another minute.  
10. Remove the chicken from heat and let them rest for 10 minutes before serving.

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

We love get-togethers with family and friends; these BBQ chicken drumsticks are a perfect addition to any cookout, picnic, or backyard gathering. 

You may be looking at the cooking time for the recipe and asking, why? Do I really have to cook drumsticks for that long? Trust me, this is process of using indirect heat yeilds the best results every time. The chicken will come out moist and cooked perfectly on the inside while still having the blistered outside you expect when eating a BBQ drumstick. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken Drumsticks: You can grill any part of the chicken with BBQ sauce, but I love barbequing drumsticks. They are easy to eat and universally well-liked. Bonus, our kids devour them. 

* BBQ Sauce: I am sure there are many tasty BBQ sauces out there I don't know about, but our family go-to is [Sweet Baby Ray's](https://amzn.to/2NsxauJ). This brand is always delicious, and they offer [sugar-free](https://amzn.to/2MYvhWR), which makes everyone in the family happy. 

* BBQ Rub: You can use your favorite rub, but we like the homemade rub used in this recipe. If you choose to go the store-bought route, we suggest using [Montreal's](https://amzn.to/2QOX1P8) mixed with a little bit of brown sugar.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large bowl 

* A baking sheet: Use the baking sheet to transport the cooked chicken to the kitchen. 

#### Are BBQ chicken drumsticks keto? Are they low-carb?

They are, substitute with sugar-free [barbeque sauce](https://amzn.to/2MYvhWR) of your choice and replace the brown sugar in the rub with [Swerve](https://amzn.to/39rvQQS) brown sugar replacement. I calculated one serving of BBQ drumsticks to make it easy for you. The serving size for the chicken is two drumsticks. 

For Chicken with the Rub: 

* CARBS– 1 Net Carb
* PROTEIN– 55g
* FAT– 13g

For the BBQ Sauce- 2 tbsp: 

* CARBS– 1 Net Carb 

#### Can I freeze BBQ Drumsticks?

Yes, first allow the drumsticks to cool completely, wrap them in aluminum foil, and add them to a freezer-safe container or Ziploc bag. The BBQ drumsticks will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm them in the oven or microwave.
