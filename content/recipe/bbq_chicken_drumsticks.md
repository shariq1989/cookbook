Servings: 4 <!--more-->

Preparation Time: 6 hours, 20 minutes

Cooking Time: 1 hour 30 minutes

Cuisine: American

#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Rub: 

* 2 tbsp Brown Sugar
* 1 tbsp Paprika
* 1 tbsp Red Chili Powder
* 2 tsp Garlic Powder
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 1/2 tsp Pepper
* 1/4 tsp Cayenne Pepper

For the Chicken: 

* 8 Chicken Drumsticks, skin-on, and bone-in 
* BBQ Sauce of your choice, we like [Sweet Baby Rays](https://amzn.to/2NsxauJ) or the [sugar-free](https://amzn.to/2MYvhWR) version

#### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Mix the spices for the rub and massage them into the drumsticks. Cover and let the meat marinate in the fridge for 6 hours.
2. Preheat the grill by setting all burners to high, about 15 minutes.
3. Turn off the rightmost burner but maintain a grill temperature of 325-350 degrees.
4. Oil the grates and cook the drumsticks on the hottest side of the grill, skin-down. Cook until they become blistered, about 5 minutes.
5. Flip the drumsticks and cook for another 5 minutes.
6. Move the drumsticks to the cool side of the grill (rightmost burner that you turned off) and cook the skin-side up for 25 minutes.
7. Flip the drumsticks and continue cooking, until the chicken has reached over 170 degrees, about 20-30 minutes. 
8. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes before serving.
