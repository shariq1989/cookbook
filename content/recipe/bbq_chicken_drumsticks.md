#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Rub: 

* 2 tbsp Brown Sugar

#### INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a large bowl, mix the spices for the rub and massage them into the drumsticks. Cover and let the meat marinate in the fridge for 6 hours.

3. Turn off the rightmost burner, but still maintain a grill temperature of 325-350 degrees.
4. Oil the grates and cook the drumsticks on the hottest side of the grill, skin-down. Cook until they become blistered, about 5 minutes.
5. Flip the drumsticks and cook for another 5 minutes.
6. Move the drumsticks to the cool side of the grill (rightmost burner that you turned off) and cook the skin-side up for 25 minutes.
7. Flip the drumsticks and continue cooking until the chicken has reached over 170 degrees, about 20-30 minutes. 
8. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes before serving.

We love get-togethers with family and friends; these drumsticks are the perfect addition to any cookout, picnic, or backyard gathering. 

#### What main ingredients do you need for this meal?

* Drumsticks: You can use any part of the chicken, but we love barbequing drumsticks for entertaining because they are easy to eat and universally well-liked. 

* BBQ Sauce: I am sure there are many tasty BBQ sauces out there that I don't know about, but our go-to time and time again is Sweet Baby Ray's. This brand is always delicious, and they offer sugar-free, which makes everyone in the family happy. 

* You can use any rub you prefer, but we like the homemade rub noted above. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large bowl 

* 2 baking sheets: To transport the marinated chicken and the cooked chicken 

#### Are these BBQ chicken drumsticks keto? Are they low-carb?

It is, as long as you use sugar-free barbeque sauce and replace the brown sugar in the rub with [Swerve](https://amzn.to/39rvQQS) brown sugar. I even calculated the macros for you to make it easier.

#### Can I freeze the BBQ Drumsticks?

Yes, first allow the drumsticks to cool completely, wrap them in aluminum foil, and add them to a freezer-safe container or Ziploc bag. The BBQ drumsticks will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm them in the oven or microwave.
