For the Roast: 

* ¼ cup Flour, All Purpose
* 2 tsp Kosher Salt 
* 1½ tsp Black Pepper, coarse ground  
* 1 1/2 tbsp Vegetable Oil 
* 3 lb Chuck Roast 
* 4 tbsp Unsalted Butter

#### Instant Pot Instructions 

1. In a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3E4oeB5), combine the flour, salt, and pepper. Cover the roast with the mixture.
2. Warm oil in an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) on saute mode until it begins to smoke. Then, add the roast and brown the meat on all sides, 4-5 minutes per side, creating a crust. 
3. Add the butter and pepperoncinis, and the place the lid on the pot- do not seal. Let it simmer this way for 5 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, prepare the ranch dressing. Combine the mayonnaise, vinegar, dill, and paprika in a small bowl and whisk to emulsify. 
5. Remove the lid and add the ranch dressing, carrots, and onion.

8. Garnish the meat with parsley and serve it as a shredded roast, or throw it on a hoagie with provolone cheese and a side of au jus.

### ABOUT THE MEAL

It's midweek, and you need a quick and easy meal; reach for this Mississippi Roast. It has both sweet and savory notes the whole family will enjoy. 

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Flour, All-Purpose 

* Kosher Salt 

* Black Pepper

* Chuck Roast: Chuck roast is the main ingredient of a Mississippi. Chuck is inexpensive and holds up well during the cooking process. It takes a while to cook to make it easy to pull apart, but it will feed a crowd. 

* Unsalted Butter 

* Pepperoncinis: I suggest adding 10-14 peppers to the dish, but if my family gave me the go-ahead, I would add even more. The pepperoncini's are the star of the roast for me, especially after they've marinated in the liquid from the meat and ranch dressing. 

* Baby Carrots

* Onion

* Fresh Parsley

* Ranch Dressing: Ranch dressing is key to a good Mississippi roast. I love the mayo, dill, and vinegar together; this ranch is a solid combination of fat and acid, and the addition of the paprika makes it even more savory. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3E4oeB5)
* An [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rOOdWW) or dutch oven 

#### Is Mississippi roast keto? Is it low-carb?

Yes, it is. However, I suggest leaving out the flour and the carrots. The roast will still sear without the flour. I calculated the macros for the Mississippi roast to make it easy for you.  

* CARBS – 3 Net Carbs
* PROTEIN – 35g 
* FAT– 53g

#### Can I freeze the roast? 

You sure can. First, allow the meat to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe bag or container. The Mississippi roast will freeze for up to 6 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove, and prepare your sides.
