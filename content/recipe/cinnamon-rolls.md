### How to Make No Yeast Cinnamon Rolls 

#### Ingredients

For the Filling:

* 2 tbsp Butter, melted
* 1/2 cup Brown Sugar, packed
* 3 tsp Cinnamon, ground
* 1/8 tsp Salt
* 1/4 cup White Sugar, granulated 

For the Cinnamon Rolls: 

* 3 cups [All-Purpose Flour](https://amzn.to/3aet0yB), plus more for rolling the dough
* 2 tbsp White Sugar, granulated
* 1 1/4 tbsp Baking Powder 
* 1/2 tsp Baking Soda 
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 1 1/4 cup Buttermilk 
* 5 tbsp Butter, melted

For the Frosting:

* 1 cup Powdered Sugar 
* 3 tbsp Butter, softened
* 1 tsp Vanilla
* 1 tbsp Milk 

#### Instructions for Quick and Easy No Yeast Cinnamon Rolls 

1. Pre-heat the oven to 425 degrees
2. Combine the ingredients for the filling in a small bowl. Mix well and set aside. 
3. In a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3188xKT), add all of the dry ingredients for the cinnamon rolls: [flour](https://amzn.to/3aet0yB), sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. 
4. Whisk the buttermilk, 5 tbsp melted butter, and vanilla together in a separate [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3188xKT) and pour the mixture into the middle of the reserved dry ingredients. Combine the ingredients until a dough forms. Do not overmix. Knead the dough and then form a smooth ball. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. 
5. On a lightly floured surface, roll the ball into a rectangle. Cover it with the reserved filling mixture, leaving room on all four sides of the dough, about 1/4 of an inch. Sprinkle lightly with cinnamon and roll the dough into a tube. Slightly trim the ends and cut them into even slices, about 10. 
6. Prepare a [baking dish](https://amzn.to/3r23qTr) and then line it with the rolls. 
7. Brush the tops of the cinnamon rolls with the melted butter and bake for 17 minutes. 
8. While the rolls are baking, let's make the icing. Using a [hand mixer](https://amzn.to/2OXaeEn), blend the softened butter, and add the vanilla. Next, slowly add the powdered sugar and blend until smooth. Next, whisk in the milk. Set aside. 
9.  Retrieve the cinnamon rolls from the oven, allow them to cool for 5-10 minutes and then drizzle them with the frosting.

### ABOUT THE CINNAMON ROLLS 

Nothing beats a warm batch of gooey cinnamon rolls. During the first Covid lockdown, we found ourselves craving a little bit of comfort.

These easy peasy cinnamon rolls deliver all the yummy goodness of cinnamon rolls, but without the prepping and proofing that comes from using yeast to make your dough. By omitting yeast from the recipe and replacing it with baking powder, the preparation time is cut in half, meaning you get the cinnamon rolls to the table even quicker.

* Baking Soda 

* Buttermilk 

* Butter

* Powdered Sugar 

* Vanilla

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

#### How should I store my cinnamon rolls? 

If somehow you end up with leftovers, the cinnamon rolls keep at room temperature for a few days. Place the leftover rolls on a plate and cover them with aluminum foil. 

#### Can I freeze cinnamon rolls?

I do not recommend freezing already baked rolls unless you bake them and leave the frosting off. I will often make two batches; I bake one and then freeze the other rolls for quick baking the next time around. To freeze the rolls, gather them together, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap, and then place them into a freezer-safe bag. The rolls will keep for up to 2 months. When you're ready to eat, let them defrost in the fridge overnight. Prepare the icing, warm your cinnamon rolls in the oven according to the baking instructions, and enjoy.
