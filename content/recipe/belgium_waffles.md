#### Can I freeze the waffles?

Yes, this is my favorite thing about making these waffles. I often double the recipe only to freeze them and have access to a quick and easy breakfast the next time. Yes, first allow the waffles to cool completely, and then add them to a freezer-safe container or Ziploc bag. The waffles will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm them in the oven or microwave.
