### ABOUT THE WAFFLES 

An alternate title for this recipe could be Birthday Waffles since birthdays are the only time we bust out this recipe. Either way, these waffles are delicious! They have a light, fluffy inside to compliment the crispy outside.

#### Can I freeze waffles?

Yes, that is actually my favorite thing about making these waffles. I often double the recipe only to freeze them, so I have access to a quick and easy breakfast the next time around. First, allow the waffles to cool completely.  Then, add them to a freezer-safe bag or container. The waffles will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let them defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm them in the oven or microwave and prepare your toppings.
