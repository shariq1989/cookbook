1 cup soft butter
2/3 cup peanut butter (I used crunchy)
1 cup sugar
1 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
2 tsp vanilla
2 2/3 cups all purpose flour
2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 cup Nutella 

1. In a large bowl, mix the brown and white sugar together, then mix in the butter and peanut with a hand-mixer until creamy.  
2. Mix in the vanilla and beat in one egg at a time 
3. In another bowl, whisk together flour, soda, salt, and baking powder, then add to the wet ingredients. Stir till thoroughly blended.
4. Add 2-3 dollops of Nutella to the dough, fold it over gently and add 2-3 more dallops. Then use a knife to swirl the Nutella into the dough. You are not mixing it in, but spreading it throughout. 
5. Cover the dough and place in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. 
6. Drop spoonfuls of dough onto lightly greased baking sheet. Bake at 350Â° for 10 minutes.
