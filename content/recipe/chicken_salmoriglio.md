### ABOUT THE MEAL

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

The main ingredients for any good salmoriglio include lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and oregano.

Chicken: For this recipe, I decided to use boneless and skinless chicken thighs for a little something different in our home. Skin-on chicken thighs would add even more flavor and texture to the dish.
