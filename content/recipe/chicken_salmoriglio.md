### ABOUT THE MEAL

Salmoriglio is a dressing used in Italian cooking, specifically Sicilian, to marinate or flavor dishes. The key ingredients for salmoriglio are lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and oregano.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken: I decided to use boneless and skinless chicken thighs to add a little variation to our usual meal rotation since I usually cook with skin-on and bone-in chicken thighs. If you prefer skin- on, and bone-in, I think it would add even more flavor and texture to an already tasty meal. 

* Lemon Juice 

* Olive Oil 

* Garlic

* Oregano

* Sun-Dried Tomatoes: These aren't usually included in a chicken salmoriglio, but they add a sweet and savory component that ended up being a part of our favorite bites. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A baking dish
