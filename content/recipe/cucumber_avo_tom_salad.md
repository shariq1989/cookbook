### ABOUT THE SALAD

If I decide to barbeque meat or grill burgers, I fix this salad; if I am cooking a Mexican entree, I make this salad;  if we are going to a potluck or get-together, I bring this salad. You get the point; I really like this salad. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Cocktail Cucumbers: You can also use regular cucumbers, but I love using cocktails. I think they are crisper than regular ones, and I love the crunch they add to the salad. 

* Avocado 

* Tomatoes

* Olive Oil 

* Lime: I used lime, but you could use lemon juice as a substitute and still achieve freshness to flavor the salad. 

* Spices: I used the dynamic duo and flavored the salad with Kosher salt and coarse ground pepper. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large [salad bowl](https://amzn.to/33n2H61) 

#### I don't like cilantro; can I use something else? 

Sure, fresh dill is a great substitute, though if you're going that route I would suggest using lemon juice in place of the lime.
