### ABOUT THE SALAD 

This salad is loaded with herbs, juicy tomato, crisp cucumber, and creamy avocado. The addition of olive oil and lime makes for a perfect light salad or side dish to any meal

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Persian Cucumber: You can also use regular cucumbers, but I prefer these. To me, they are more crisp than regular ones, and I love the crunch they add. 

* Tomato: I reach for the tomato medley for this salad, mostly because I like all the color. Use what you have though- cherry tomatoes, grape tomatoes, or roma tomatoes. 

* Avocado 

* Garlic 

* Olive Oil  

* Salt and Pepper 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

#### I don't like cilantro; can I use something else? 

Sure, fresh dill is a great substitute. If you go this route, I suggest using lemon juice in place of the lime to compliment the flavor.
