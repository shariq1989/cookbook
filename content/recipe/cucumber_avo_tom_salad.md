### ABOUT THE SALAD 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Cocktail Cucumbers: You can use regular cucumbers, but I prefer cocktails. To me, they are crisper than regular ones, and I love the crunch they add. 

* Avocado 

* Tomatoes

* Olive Oil 

* Lime: I use lime, but lemon juice would achieve the same freshness to flavor the salad. 

* Spices: I used the dynamic duo and flavored the salad with Kosher salt and coarse ground pepper.

#### Is this salad vegetarian? Is it vegan?

Our cucumber, avocado, and tomato salad naturally suit both a vegetarian and vegan diet. 

#### I don't like cilantro; can I use something else? 

Sure, fresh dill is a great substitute. If you do, I suggest using lemon juice in place of the lime.
