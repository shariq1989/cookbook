### ABOUT THE SALAD 

This salad is full of herbs, juicy tomato, crisp cucumber, and creamy avocado. The addition of olive oil and lime lends flavor to this perfect light salad or side dish for any meal. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Persian Cucumber: You can also use regular cucumbers, but I prefer these. To me, they are crisper than regular ones, and I love the crunch they add. 

* Tomato: I reach for the tomato medley for this salad, mostly because I like all the colors. Use what you have - cherry tomatoes, grape tomatoes, or Roma tomatoes. 

* Avocado 

* Garlic 

* Olive Oil  

* Salt and Pepper 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [sharp knife](https://amzn.to/2R6C2Yp)

* A [salad bowl](https://amzn.to/33n2H61) 

#### I don't like cilantro; can I use something else? 

Sure, fresh dill is a great substitute. If you go this route, I suggest using lemon juice in place of the lime to compliment the flavor. 

#### What additions or changes could I make to this salad? 

* Red onions
* Slice fresh mozzarella to make an avocado, tomato, cucumber, and mozzarella salad
* Corn
* Crumble feta cheese and add it for cucumber, tomato, avocado, feta salad
* Basil
* Make the salad a whole meal by adding canned salmon or tuna
* A bed of greens like spinach and arugula
