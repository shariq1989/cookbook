4. Then, add the garlic and half of the ginger, saute until golden.
5. Next, add the onions and fry them until they become translucent and soften, about 8 minutes 
6. Return the goat to the pan and mix in the yogurt and salt. Stir to combine and let it cook over high heat until the yogurt releases liquid.

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

Bhuna gosht is a popular dish in Pakistan and India. It often refers to a thick, dry curry made with either goat or lamb, slow-cooked in whole spices. The curry reduces during the cooking process, leaving behind a highly concentrated and flavorful masala.  

Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with Desi food. If you asked me the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry, I couldn’t have told you. Learning how to cook Indian food is something I treasure, especially since I have the honor of learning Desi cooking under my talented mother-in-law. She prepares food off-script, so you have to watch her closely as she buzzes through the kitchen, or you miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build upon flavors and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by what I have learned cooking alongside her.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Gosht: "Gosht," means meat, but most often, in Indian and Pakistani cuisine, gosht most often refers to goat or lamb; we prefer to use goat for this dish. 

* Onions: Thinly sliced onions and a lot of them. 

* Whole Spices: We use boriya chilis, bay leaves, whole cinnamon stick, cloves, black peppercorns, green cardamom, black cardamom, and stir in ground nutmeg since we don't often have the whole nutmeg on hand. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A Heavy-Bottomed Pan or [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3vv0Usv)

#### Can you freeze bhuna gosht?

Yes, allow the dish to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container. Bhuna gosht will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it on the stovetop, and prepare your rice or naan.
