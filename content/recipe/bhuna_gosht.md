#### STOVE-TOP INSTRUCTIONS

2. Gather the whole spices and stir in the nutmeg.
3. When the meat finishes, heat 1/3 cup of ghee in the pan used to cook the meat and add the reserved spice mixture until they begin to sputter.
4. Then, add the garlic and half of the ginger, saute until golden.
5. Next, add the onions and fry until they become translucent and soften, about 8 minutes 
6. Return the goat to the pan and mix in the yogurt and salt. Stir to combine and cook over high heat until the yogurt releases liquid.
7. Reduce the heat to medium and cover the pan with a lid. Allow the dish to simmer for about 5 minutes.
8. Stir in the coriander powder, turmeric, Kashmiri chili powder, and mix well.

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

Bhuna gosht is a popular dish in Pakistan and India. It often refers to a thick, dry curry made with either goat or lamb, slow-cooked in whole spices. The curry reduces during the cooking process, leaving behind a highly concentrated and flavorful masala.  

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Gosht: In Hindi, gosht means meat, but more often than not, in Indian and Pakistani cuisine, gosht refers to goat or lamb; we prefer goat for this dish. 

* Onions: Thinly slice the onions and use a lot of them. 

* Whole Spices: We use boriya chillies, bay leaves, whole cinnamon stick, cloves, black peppercorns, green cardamom, black cardamom, and then stir in ground nutmeg since whole nutmeg is difficult to come by. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A Heavy-Bottomed Pan or [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3vv0Usv)

#### Can I freeze bhuna gosht?

Yes, allow the dish to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container. Bhuna gosht will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it on the stovetop, and prepare your rice or naan.
