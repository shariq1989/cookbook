### ABOUT THE MEAL

The development of this recipe came about by happy mistake. Have you ever taken stock of your pantry and refrigerator and pretended you were on Chopped? No? Me neither. Okay, maybe that is a thing I do, but in any case, that is how this recipe came to be. I originally made it with chuck roast before deciding to use chuck short rib instead. We also fine-tuned the recipes with a few tasty additions along the way.  

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Chuck Short Rib: Short rib tenderizes well and has a rich flavor. You could also use a chuck roast. 

* Chickpeas: They are a quality source of fiber and complement the beef well in this stew. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A small bowl 
* A large [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/38xuVO8) or an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rRWIjZ)
* A pair of [tongs](https://amzn.to/2OqsiXM)

#### Is this stew vegetarian? Is this stew Vegan?

Yes. Use potatoes instead of beef in this recipe, or double the chickpea amount. If vegan, replace the butter with your favorite vegan butter, use Vegetable Better Than Bouillion as a substitute, and leave out the yogurt for garnish.

#### Can I freeze the beef and chickpea stew? 

You sure can. First, allow the dish to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container. The beef and chickpea stew can freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm on the stovetop, and enjoy!
