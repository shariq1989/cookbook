GRILLED CHICKEN KABOBS

Preparation Time: 10 minutes <!--more-->
Marination Time: 24 hours 
Servings: 3-4 
Cuisine: Persian 

#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Marinade: 

* 4 Chicken Breast, boneless and skinless, cut into 2-inch pieces 
* 1 small White Onion, thinly sliced 
* 1/3 cup Lemon Juice 
* 1/8 tsp Ground Saffron Powder 
* 1/4 tsp Salt 
* 1/4 tsp Pepper 

For the Kabob: 

* 1/4 cup Olive Oil, plus more for brushing over the vegetables 
* 3-4 small Tomatoes, cut in half 
* 3-4 small Red Onions, cut in half  
* 3-4 Mini Peppers, whole 
* 2-3 Serrano Peppers, whole 
* Salt and Pepper, sprinkled over vegetables, to taste 

#### DIRECTIONS 

For the Marinade: 

1. Trim any fat from the chicken breasts and then cut them into 2-inch pieces. Put them into a large bowl
2. Next, add the onion slices, lemon juice, saffron, salt, and pepper to the bowl. Toss to coat, ensuring all chicken pieces take on a the rich, yellow saffron color. Then stir in the olive oil to combine.
4. Cover the bowl and allow the chicken to marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before grilling. 

For the Kabob: 

1. Prepare the grill by removing the grate and setting it to high heat. 
2. Using narrow skewers, skewer the tomatoes, onions, peppers, and serrano. Brush them lightly with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper, to taste. 
3. Next, skewer the chicken. 
4. Place metal bars over your grill to rest the skewers on. We just used some of our leftover skewers to rest the meat and vegetables on while they cooked. 
5. If the grill is too small, be sure to grill the vegetables first, and keep them warm with aluminium foil while you grill the chicken. 
6. Place the chicken skewers on the grill over high heat. As soon as one side begins changing color, grill the other side to seal the juiciness of the chicken. Keep turning the skewers until they are golden brown on all sides. Check a piece by cutting into it with a knife. 
7. Remove the chicken and serve immediately with slices of lemon along with the vegetables and either Persian rice or Persian bread or both!
