#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Wrap: 

* 2 tbsp Sesame Oil, divided, plus more to garnish
* 1 lb Ground Beef 
* 2 tbsp Garlic, minced 
* 1 tbsp Soy Sauce 
* 2 tsp Ginger, minced 
* 1 tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar 
* 3 tsp Sriracha 
* 1/4 cup store-bought or homemade hoisen, plus more for garnish
* 4 Scallions, sliced and white and greens seperated 
* Butter or Romaine Lettuce, washed and patted dry 
* Optional: Toasted Peanuts, to garnish 

For the Homemade Hoisin Sauce: 

* 3 tbsp Soy Sauce 
* 1/2 tsp Ginger Paste 
* 1 tbsp Sesame Oil 
* 1 tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar 
* 1 tbsp Monkfruit Sweetener or Honey 
* 1 tbsp Natural Almond Butter 

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. If doing so, prepare the ingredients in a small bowl for the homemade hoisin sauce, set aside. 
2. In a medium skillet, warm 1 tbsp sesame oil over medium heat. 
3. Add the ground beef and cook thoroughly, breaking up the meat until it is finely minced. 
4. While the meat is cooking, mix together the garlic, ginger, soy sauce, white wine vinegar, and siracha. Stir the mixture into the meat, along with the hoisin sauce until thoroughly combined. 
5. Cover the mixture with a lid and simmer, about 5 minutes. If you like your meat to have a stickier texture, you can add 1 tbsp of water at this time. 
6. Remove the lid and lower the heat, allow the beef mixture to reduce, about 2-5 minutes. 
7. Garnish with the green scallions and peanuts and drizzle with sesame oil and homemade hoisin, to taste. 
8. Serve on butter or romaine lettuce.
