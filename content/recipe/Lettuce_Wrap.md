### ABOUT THE MEAL 

There are many versions of this copycat on the internet; this is the Jamil Family take on the popular dish. These lettuce wraps are healthy, but more importantly, they're easy to make! There are very few recipes that make it to the regular rotation in our home, but this is one of them. Best of all, they are both adult and kid-approved. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Ground Beef: Lean ground beef is our preferred meat to use, but ground chicken or turkey would work fine. Whatever meat you use, be sure that it is finely minced; I use a meat chopper to make my job easier.  
 
* Hoisin Sauce: While store-bought hoisin is super tasty, it's high in sugar content. If you're concerned about sugar, like our family, we recommend making the homemade hoisin sauce suggested in the recipe. If you don't have the ingredients or the time to make your own, store-bought hoisin will be fine. 

* Ginger Flavor: We introduce ginger to this dish in two ways: fresh, minced ginger and ginger paste. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

#### Can I freeze the beef?

Yes, first allow the meat to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container. To prevent freezer burn, you can also layer saran wrap over the dish before securing the lid. The beef mixture will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your lettuce and hoisin sauce.
