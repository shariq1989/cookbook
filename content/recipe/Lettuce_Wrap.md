Servings: 4-6 <!--more-->

#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Wrap: 

* 2 tbsp Sesame Oil, divided, plus more to garnish
* 1 lb Ground Beef 
* 2 tbsp Garlic, minced 
* 1 tbsp Soy Sauce 
* 2 tsp Ginger, minced 
* 1 tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar 
* 3 tsp Sriracha 
* 1/4 cup Homemade Hoisin, plus more for garnish
* 4 Scallions, sliced and white and greens seperated 
* Butter or Romaine Lettuce, washed and patted dry 
* Optional: Toasted Peanuts, to garnish 

For the Homemade Hoisin Sauce: 

* 4 tbsp Soy Sauce 
* 1 tsp Ginger Paste 
* 1 1/2 tbsp Sesame Oil 
* 1 1/2 tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar 
* 1 1/2  tbsp Monkfruit Sweetener or Honey 
* 1 tbsp Natural Almond Butter 

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Before cooking, prepare the ingredients in a small bowl for the homemade hoisin sauce, set aside. 
2. In a medium skillet, warm the sesame oil over medium heat. 
3. Add the ground beef and cook thoroughly, breaking up the meat until it is finely minced. 
4. While the meat is cooking, mix together the garlic, ginger, soy sauce, white wine vinegar, and siracha. Stir the mixture into the meat, along with the homemade hoisin  until thoroughly combined. 
5. Cover the mixture with a lid and simmer, about 5 minutes. If you like your meat to have a stickier texture, add 1 tbsp of water. 
6. Remove the lid and lower the heat, allow the beef mixture to reduce, about 2-5 minutes. 
7. Garnish with the greens from the scallions, peanuts, and drizzle with sesame oil. Use the reserved homemade hoisin and serve as a dipping sauce alongside the wraps.  
8. Serve on butter or romaine lettuce. 




THE STORY BEHIND THE MEAL 

These lettuce wraps are healthy and most importantly, they are easy to make! There are very few recipes that make it to the regular rotation in our home, and this is one of them. Best of all, they are both adult and child approved. A quick note about the recipe, while store-bought hoisin is super tasty, it is high in sugar content. For those concerned about sugar intake, like our family, we recommend making our homemade hoisin instead (see directions above).
