Servings: 4-6 <!--more-->

Preparation Time: 15 minutes 

Cooking Time: 20 minutes 

Cuisine: American Chinese 

#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Wrap: 

* 2 tbsp [Sesame Oil](https://amzn.to/3b72o2v), divided, plus more to garnish
* 1 lb Ground Beef 
* 2 Garlic Cloves, minced 
* 1 tbsp Soy Sauce 
* 2 tsp Ginger, minced 
* 1 tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar 
* 3 tsp Sriracha 
* 1/4 cup Homemade Hoisin, plus more for garnish
* 4 Scallions, sliced and whites and greens, separated 
* Butter or Romaine Lettuce, washed and patted dry 
* Optional: Peanuts, toasted, to garnish 

For the Homemade Hoisin Sauce: 

* 4 tbsp Soy Sauce 
* 1 tsp Ginger Paste 
* 1 1/2 tbsp Sesame Oil 
* 1 1/2 tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar 
* 1 1/2 tbsp [Monk Fruit Sweetener](https://amzn.to/38Bp8aG) or Honey 
* 1 tbsp Natural [Almond Butter Powder](https://amzn.to/3laVGgE)

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Before cooking, prepare the ingredients in a small bowl for the homemade hoisin sauce. Set aside. 
2. In a medium skillet, warm the sesame oil over medium heat and then add the ground beef and cook thoroughly. Break up the meat with a [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/38BSlBY) until finely minced. Cook until the meat becomes brown, 8-10 minutes.  
3. While the meat is cooking, mix the garlic, ginger, soy sauce, white wine vinegar, and siracha into a small bowl. Stir the mixture into the beef, along with the homemade hoisin, until thoroughly combined. 
4. Cover the mixture with a lid and simmer for about 5 minutes. If you prefer a thicker sauce, add 1 tbsp of water. 
5. Remove the lid and lower the heat, allow the beef mixture to reduce, about 2-5 minutes. 
6. Garnish with the greens from the scallions, peanuts, and drizzle with sesame oil. Use the reserved homemade hoisin and serve as a dipping sauce alongside the wraps.  Serve on butter or romaine lettuce. 

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

There are many versions of this copycat on the internet; this is the Jamil Family take on the popular dish. These lettuce wraps are healthy, but more importantly, they're easy to make! There are very few recipes that make it to the regular rotation in our home, but this is one of them. Best of all, they are both and kid-approved. 

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Ground Beef: Beef is our preferred meat to use, but ground chicken or turkey would be fine as well. Whatever meat you use, be sure that it is finely minced; I use a meat chopper to make my job easier.  
 
* Hoisin Sauce: While store-bought hoisin is super tasty, it's high in sugar content. If you're concerned about sugar, like our family, we recommend making the homemade hoisin sauce suggested in the recipe. If you don't have the ingredients or the time to make your own, store-bought hoisin will be fine. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* 2 small bowls
* A medium skillet with a lid 
* A [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/38BSlBY)

#### Are these lettuce wraps keto? Are these lettuce wraps lowcarb?

Macros for the Wraps: 
* CARBS– 2 Net Carbs

#### Can I freeze the beef?

Yes, first allow the meat to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container. To prevent freezer burn, you can also layer saran wrap over the dish before securing the lid. The beef mixture will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your lettuce and hoisin sauce.
