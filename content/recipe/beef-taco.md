#### Instructions 

For the Corn Tortillas:

2. In a [skillet](https://amzn.to/3qPphRG), warm 1/4 cup of oil over medium-high heat. 
3. When the oil begins to smoke, add the corn tortilla and cook for 15-30 seconds.

### ABOUT THE MEAL

My family didn’t have money growing up, and we rotated a few meals throughout the week. One dish I always looked forward to my mom making was ground beef tacos. I must have passed this joy onto my son because this is his most requested meal. He is the reason I decided to post this recipe; he very genuinely told me the other day, “Mama, people need to know how to make this meal so they can feed it to their kids.”  

Well, we certainly hope you enjoy this easy ground beef taco meal as much as we do.

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Corn Tortillas 

* Avocado Oil 

* Onion 

* Ground Beef: I use lean ground beef. If you choose to use beef with a higher fat content, just be sure to drain the excess oil after the meat is fully browned.

* Garlic 

* Cilantro 

* Garlic Powder 

* Salt 

* Taco Seasoning: I know I could have made taco seasoning from scratch to make my mom's dish more original and unique, but I decided to reach for [Ortegas Taco Seasoning](https://amzn.to/3q8Va3F), garlic powder, and salt like she always did because there is something special about a meal from childhood, even if it's simple.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe? 

For the Corn Tortillas: 
* A [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3Cvqcsq)
* A [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3qP6fL9) 
* A [skillet](https://amzn.to/3qPphRG)

For the Tacos: 
* A small bowl 
* A [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/3bQ2coS)
* A [saute pan](https://amzn.to/3oE3WYv)

#### Can I freeze cooked ground beef? 

Yes, you can. First, allow the meat to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. To prevent freezer burn, layer plastic wrap over the container before securing the lid. The ground beef will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your tortillas and toppings.
