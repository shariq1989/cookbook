### ABOUT THE MEAL

If you are craving biryani and don't have time to make it, try this quick and easy recipe. Traditionally, biryani is an intricate dish made with beautiful layers of meat or vegetables and rice. This chicken biryani recipe is easy to make but has all the traditional Pakistani and Indian flavors that come to mind when you think of biryani. It has all the flavor and brightness of the popular dish, but it cuts the preparation and cooking time in half. You can make this recipe on the stove-top or in the Instant Pot. 

#### Where does biryani originate? 

The word biryani derives from the Persian word “biran" which means, “fried before cooking." As such, historians believe the flavorful rice dish was born out of Persia. So how did this popular dish arrive in India? Biryani was introduced to Northern India by the Mughals- a group also credited for bringing pilau and kebabs; our family is forever grateful for that.

Like many well-known Indian dishes, biryani varies from region to region. Interestingly, this dish has a unique preparation in almost every area across the subcontinent. Some variations of biryani include: 
* Hyderabadi Dum Biryani
* Sindhi Biryani 
* Karachi Biryani
* Chettinad Biryani 
* Cutchi Biryani 
* Among others...

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Long-Grained Basmati Rice: Use [Authentic Basmati Rice](https://amzn.to/3cuai6I), or [Daawat Traditional Basmati Rice](https://amzn.to/2PSJxRL). The key to a quality rice dish is taking the time to soak it in water beforehand; the longer, the better. By taking this step, your rice will have the length and luxury you want from good biryani.

* Biryani Masala: I chose to make a quick and easy biryani masala using a combination of Kashmiri chili powder, garam masala, turmeric, salt, and Laziza Karahi Masala. You can also use a pre-made biryani masala like [Shan](https://amzn.to/3cGWNk9) to make the recipe even more manageable. 

* Chicken: I prefer to use bone-in chicken like thighs, legs, and quarters. If you favor boneless chicken, I suggest using thighs. There are also two ways to prepare biryani. You can make kachi biryani, which allows for the raw meat and rice to cook together as we have in this recipe. The other option would be to cook the meat beforehand and allow the cooked meat and rice to steam together. This method is called pakki biryani. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large serving bowl or [platter](https://amzn.to/3oc3X5q)
* An [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rJDIEg) 
* A [rice cooker](https://amzn.to/2OJpyED)

#### Can I make chicken biryani vegetarian? Can I make it vegan? 

I love biryani because the options for protein are endless. Some of the more common biryani's include boiled eggs, mixed vegetables, or a mixture of the two. If making a mixed vegetable biryani, I suggest using a combination of green beans, cauliflower, carrots, and peas. To make the biryani vegan, you will want to replace the yogurt and the ghee with something vegan-friendly. I suggest using coconut-based yogurt and vegan butter instead. 

#### Can I make chicken biryani non-dairy? 

The yogurt is used to tenderize the meat; you could use a coconut-based yogurt to achieve this or use tomatoes to achieve the same effect. 

#### Why do I separate the rice in this recipe? 

When cooking biriyani in the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rJDIEg), the rice at the bottom can end up a bit sticky. I counteract this by reserving a portion of rice that is light and fluffy to mix with it. If you are in a hurry, there is no need to separate the rice. Instead, add all of the rice, along with three cups of water to the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rJDIEg) before cooking. 

#### Can I freeze biryani?

Yes, allow the dish to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. Biryani will freeze for up to 2 months. When you're ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm up a single serving in the microwave or add it all to a pan for a quick and easy meal the whole family will enjoy.
