### How to Make Paratha 

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 3 cups All-Purpose Flour 
* 1 tsp Salt 
* 1 Egg
* 3 tbsp Ghee, plus more for rolling and frying 
* 1 cup Water, added little by little 

#### DIRECTIONS 

For the Dough: 

1. In a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3pfcyoK), add the flour using a [sieve](https://amzn.to/3riGBP1).
2. Next, whisk in the salt and add the egg and ghee. Slowly add water, a little bit at a time. Mix with your hands until a soft dough forms. 
3. Knead the dough for 4 to 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and roll it into a ball. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and set it aside for 30 minutes.
4. Divide the dough into pieces and roll them into balls using your palms. 

Rolling the Parathas: Circular Method 

1. Take a dough ball and gently press it between your palms, creating a circular shape.
2. On a lightly floured surface, roll the flattened ball into a larger circle using a [rolling pin](https://amzn.to/3IfLKxA), about 4-inches in diameter. 
3. Spread ghee over the rolled-out dough and sprinkle them with flour.
4. Fold the dough, and then roll it into a disc once again, 6-inches in diameter. 

Cooking the Parathas: 

1. Warm a [skillet](https://amzn.to/3lfN0XB) over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, carefully add the rolled out paratha and cook until the bottom of the paratha changes color, about 1 minute.
2. With a spatula, flip the paratha and top it with ghee, spreading it evenly over the surface. Cook until it turns light brown, about 2 minutes.
3. Flip the paratha and top that side with ghee, spreading it evenly over the surface. Cook until light brown, 1 to 2 minutes.
4. Repeat with the remaining dough.

### ABOUT THE MEAL

Parathas are a staple in Indian homes, and for good reason. They are tasty! Parathas are unleavened bread made by layering and rolling dough that is cooked until it becomes golden brown. Parathas are eaten with breakfast, lunch, or dinner. In our home, they are a regular part of our breakfast rotation; we enjoy them with eggs and achar (or pickled mangos).

#### How can I store parathas? 

The dough can be refrigerated in an air-tight container for up to 3 days. When using refrigerated dough, allow the dough to come to room temperature before rolling.
Cooked Parathas can be refrigerated for 3 to 4 days or frozen for longer shelf life. Reheat the parathas on a stove-top griddle with a sprinkle of oil or ghee.
