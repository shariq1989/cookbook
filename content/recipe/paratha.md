### How to Make Parathas 

#### Ingredients  

* 3 cups All-Purpose Flour 
* 1 tsp Salt 
* 1 Egg
* 3 tbsp Ghee, plus more for rolling and frying 
* 1 cup Water, added little by little 

#### Directions 

For the Dough: 

1. In a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3pfcyoK), add the flour using a [sieve](https://amzn.to/3riGBP1).
2. Next, whisk in the salt and add the egg and ghee. Slowly add water, a little bit at a time. Mix with your hands until a soft dough forms. 
3. Knead the dough for 4 to 5 minutes until smooth, and roll it into a ball. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and set it aside for 30 minutes.
4. Divide the dough into pieces and roll them into balls using your palms. 

Rolling the Parathas: Circular Method 

1. Take a dough ball and gently press it between your palms, creating a circular shape.
2. On a lightly floured surface, roll the flattened ball into a larger circle using a [rolling pin](https://amzn.to/3IfLKxA), about 4-inches in diameter. 
3. Spread ghee over the rolled-out dough and sprinkle them with flour.
4. Fold the dough, and then roll it into a disc again, 6-inches in diameter. 

Cooking the Parathas: 

1. Warm a [skillet](https://amzn.to/3lfN0XB) over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, carefully add the rolled-out paratha and cook until the bottom of the paratha changes color, about 1 minute.
2. With a spatula, flip the paratha and top it with ghee, spreading it evenly over the surface. Cook until it turns light brown, about 2 minutes.
3. Flip the paratha and top that side with ghee, spreading it evenly over the surface. Cook until light brown, 1 to 2 minutes.
4. Repeat with the remaining dough.
