#### INGREDIENTS 

* ⅓ CUP Soy Sauce 
* 3 TBSP. Rice Wine Vinegar 
* 4 TBSP. White Sugar, divided 
* 2 Large Eggs Whites, lightly beaten 
* 2 LBS. Chicken Thighs, skinless and cut into 1 in. pieces 
* 2 CUPS of Corn Starch
* ½ CUP Sichuan Peppers, toasted and finely ground 
* 2 TSP. Kosher Salt 
* 2 Quarts Peanut Oil 
* 8 Scallion, thinly sliced 
* 1 CUP Cilantro Leaves 
* 6 TBSP. Sichuan Oil 
* 1 TBSP. Sichuan Seasoning Salt 


#### DIRECTIONS 
1. In a large bowl, combine soy sauce, vinegar, 2 TBSP. sugar, and the egg whites. Stir until the sugar dissolves. 
2. Add chicken to the mixture and stir to coat, then cover and let marinate for 20-30 min. 
3. Meanwhile, set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet. 
4. In a large bowl, stir together 2 TBSP. sugar, cornstarch, sichuan peppers, and salt. 
5. Drain the chicken in the colander. 
6. Add ⅓ of the chicken to the cornstarch and toss to coat completely, pressing the pieces into the cornstarch. 
7. Transfer the coated chicken to a mesh strainer and shake to remove excess cornstarch. Transfer to the prepared rack in a single layer and repeat with the remaining chicken and cornstarch mixture. 
8. In a large dutch oven, over medium heat, heat the peanut oil to 350 degrees. Add half of the coated chicken and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until well browned, about 5 min. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to another wire rack. 
9. Allow the oil to reach 350 degrees again and repeat with the remaining chicken. 
10. In a small bowl, microwave the sichuan chili oil for 30 secs. 
11. Combine the hot fried chicken and scallions in a large bowl, sprinkle with sichuan seasoning salt and drizzle with the warm chili oil, then toss to coat. 
12. Add cilantro and toss again. 
13. Serve with additional chili oil.
