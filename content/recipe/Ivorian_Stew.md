#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a small bowl, mix together the ingredients for the Kedjenou Spice Mix. Use 2 tbsp to cover the chicken or lamb. 
2. Heat oil in an Instant Pot on saute mode. Add the lamb or chicken and saute for 4 minutes, moving around so all sides sear evenly. 
3. Add the tomatoes, onion, garlic, and other vegetables, and 1-2 tbsp of Kedjenou Spice Mix (leftover spice mix can last for 3 months if stored in a seeled mason jar). 
4. Add ½ cup water. 
5. Secure the Instant Pot lid and cook on high pressure for 50 minutes with a quick release. (This cooking time is for high elevation. Reduce the cooking time for lower elevation). 
6. Serve with rice or eat as a stew.
