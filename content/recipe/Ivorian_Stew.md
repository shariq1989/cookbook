#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Stew: 

* 1 lb Chicken or Lamb, cut into 1-2-inch pieces
* 4 large Tomatoes, diced 
* 2 Onions, diced 
* 4 Garlic Cloves 
* 2 medium Carrots, sliced 
* 5 Red Potatoes, quartered 
* 2 cup Water
* 1 tsp [Chicken Better than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/3rR71VA)

For the Kedjenou Spice Mix:

* 1 tbsp Garlic Powder 
* ½ tsp Sugar 
* ½ tsp Cinnamon, ground 
* 1½ tbsp Paprika 
* Salt, to taste
* Pepper, to taste
* ½ tsp Cayenne Pepper 
* 1 tsp [Turmeric](https://amzn.to/3tpsxkL)
  
#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a small bowl, mix the ingredients for the Kedjenou Spice Mix. Use 2 tbsp to cover the chicken or lamb. 
2. Warm the oil in an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) on saute mode. Add the lamb or chicken and saute for 4 minutes, moving around so that all the sides sear evenly. 
3. Add the tomatoes, onion, garlic, and other vegetables, and 1-2 tbsp of Kedjenou Spice Mix. The leftover spice mix can last for 3 months if stored in a sealed mason jar. 
4. Add ½ cup water and then secure the Instant Pot lid. Set on manual high pressure for 50 minutes with a quick release. This cooking time is for high elevation. Reduce the cooking time for lower elevation. 
5. Serve on a bed of rice or eat as a stew.
