### About the Appetizer 

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Eggs 

* Dijon Mustard: Dijon is a little spicy and a little tangy so it flavors the eggs well.  

* Mayonnaise

* Pickle Brine: Pickles are serious business in our home, and so is the brine it comes in. You typically won't go wrong using pickles found in the deli section of the grocery store, but if you want that good, good, then use the brine from Grillos Pickles if you can find them near you.
