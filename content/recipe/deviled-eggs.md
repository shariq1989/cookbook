### About the Deviled Eggs  

Deviled eggs are a perfect appetizer for gatherings and get-togethers. Whether it's for a birthday, barbeque, Easter picnic, Thanksgiving, or another holiday, you are likely to find this dish somewhere on the table. All you need to make the best-deviled eggs recipe our family loves is mayonnaise, mustard, paprika, and just a spill of pickle juice.

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Eggs 

* Dijon Mustard: Dijon is spicy and a little tangy, so it flavors the egg mixture well.  

* [Mayonnaise](https://amzn.to/3lHUpPH): I live in North Carolina, and Duke's Mayo is the only option (if you know, you know). 

* Pickle Brine: Pickles are serious business in our home, and so is the brine it comes in. Search for the best pickles in the deli section of the grocery store, but if you want that good-good, then use the brine from Grillos Pickles. 

* [Smoked Paprika](https://amzn.to/2ZzYHAO)

* Kosher Salt

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [sauce pan](https://amzn.to/335bAEl) or [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ)
* A small bowl 
* A serving platter 
* Optional: A [food processor](https://amzn.to/3Dtt1Lh), [blender](https://amzn.to/3Ds9LxF), or [immersion blender](https://amzn.to/3DtTU1u)

#### How can I dress up my deviled eggs? 

* [Pickled Onions]({{< ref "pickled-onions" >}})
* Bacon 
* [Sriracha](https://amzn.to/3xX8UUF)
* Pickles
* Jalapenos or Serranos 
* Pickled Shallots
* Cajun Seasoning 
* Chives 
* Avocado: Use it as a topping or blend it with the egg mixture; this would be great for a fun Green Eggs and Ham meal with your family.
