description = "Chongqing laziji or Chongqing chicken is a famous Sichuan dish made of marinated and deep-fried chicken with fragrant Arbol chilies and mouth-numbing Sichuan peppercorns. Chongqing chicken is characterized by a heaping pile of dried red chilis alongside small pieces of crispy, tender chicken, which are traditionally plucked out using chopsticks, leaving most of the chilies behind. This dish looks intimidating at first glance, especially with all of those chilis, but don't be. The main ingredients for mala chicken include dark, bone-in chicken thighs, garlic, ginger, dried red chilis, and Sichuan peppercorns. This recipe can be modified to fit a gluten-free diet by using chickpea flour instead of all-purpose flour and Tamari sauce instead of dark soy sauce. The result is an irresistible moist chicken dish our family loves."

* 2 tbsp White Sugar, granulated
* 2 large Eggs Whites, lightly beaten 

For the Fried Chicken:

* 2 lb Chicken Thighs, skinless and boneless, cut into 1-inch pieces 
* 1 tsp Kosher Salt
* 2 cup Corn Starch
* 2 qt Canola Oil 

For the Dish: 

* 1 tbsp [Chili Oil](https://amzn.to/3lo3sUi)
* 1 tbsp Canola Oil
* 1 tsp [Sichuan Chilis](https://amzn.to/2OEuomZ), dried
* 1 cup [Arbol Chilis](https://amzn.to/3c4M7M9), dried, cut into small pieces 
* 1-inch Fresh Ginger, peeled and julienne
* 4 Garlic Cloves, julienne
* 1/2 tsp White Sugar, granulated 
* 1 tsp [Shaoxing Wine](https://amzn.to/3xSkT5T)
* 8 Scallion, thinly sliced, whites and greens separated
* 1 tsp Toasted Sesame Seeds

#### Instructions 

1. In a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3EC3u3G), combine the ingredients for the marinade: soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and egg whites. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Add the chicken to the [bowl](https://amzn.to/3EC3u3G). Stir to coat, cover, and let it marinate for 30 minutes.  
2. Meanwhile, set the [wire racks](https://amzn.to/3GeXFK9) into the [rimmed baking sheets](https://amzn.to/3rJGAUq). 
3. In another [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3EC3u3G), combine cornstarch and salt. 
4. Retrieve the marinated chicken and leave it to drain in a [colander](https://amzn.to/3rCmvzl), 1-2 minutes. 
5. Add ⅓ of the chicken to the cornstarch and toss to coat, pressing the pieces into the mixture. Shake the chicken pieces to remove any excess cornstarch and transfer them to one of the prepared racks. Repeat with the remaining chicken and cornstarch mixture. 
6. In a [Dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3Epj4Qc), over medium heat, warm oil to 350 degrees. Add half of the coated chicken in a single layer and cook until both sides brown, about 3-5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to the other prepared [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3GeXFK9). 
7. Allow the oil to reach 350 degrees again and repeat with the remaining chicken. 
8. In a heavy-bottomed pan or [wok](https://amzn.to/3rAkyDH), heat the chili oil, canola oil, Arbol chilies, and Sichuan chilies until they begin to sputter. 
9. Next, add the garlic, ginger, sugar, and rice wine. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring regularly. 
10. Add the fried chicken to the mixture and toss to combine. 
11. Garnish with scallions and serve with jasmine rice.

When you’re ready to eat, let the chicken defrost in the fridge overnight; to serve, bake the chicken in the oven and warm the sauce in a pan. Toss the chicken with the sauce, and enjoy.
