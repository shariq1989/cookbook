### ABOUT THE MEAL

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Long-Grain White Rice: This recipe calls for long-grain white rice, which is our family's preferred choice. You could substitute for brown rice, but you will need to increase the cooking time. Don't forget to toast your rice; this step helps the rice maintain its texture during the cooking process. 

* Tomatoes: I prefer fresh Roma tomatoes, but you can also substitute canned, diced tomatoes. 

* Broth: Broth flavors the rice during the cooking process much more than just water. 

* Jalapenos: We use jalapenos, but if you want flavor and a bit more spice, you can substitute for serrano peppers. 

* Cilantro: If you're a part of the group of people who sadly taste soap when eating cilantro, then skip this ingredient. Otherwise, you want cilantro in this dish. I add it right at the end and adds brightness and freshness to the rice. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A food processor or blender 
* A sauce pan
* A large [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/38xuVO8) or an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rRWIjZ)

#### Is Mexican rice vegetarian? Is it vegan?

Mexican rice caters well to both a vegetarian and vegan diet. Just be sure to use the [Vegetable Better than Bouillion](https://amzn.to/31eZDI9). 

#### Can I freeze Mexican rice? 

You sure can. First, allow the dish to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe bag or container. The Mexican rice can freeze for up to 6 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator. To serve, warm it on the stovetop, and enjoy.
