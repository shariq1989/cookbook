* 1 tsp [Turmeric Powder](https://amzn.to/3vyvAZK)
* 1 tsp Homemade [Garam Masala](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/pakistani_garam_masala/)

#### CHANNA MASALA STOVE-TOP INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Warm ghee in a [heavy-bottomed pan](https://amzn.to/3F0cvEn) over medium-high heat. Add 1 tsp of the kalonji seeds, the cumin seed, and the green chillies. Cook until ingredients begin to sputter.
2. Lower the heat to medium-low, and then add the onion. Cook until they brown and caramelize. This step may take a while, and that’s okay. You are building flavor.
3. Next, add the garlic and ginger. Stir to combine.
4. In a small bowl, combine chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, and coriander powder. Stir the spices into the mixture until it becomes fragrant, about 30 seconds.
5. Add the tomatoes and allow the gravy to simmer for 5 minutes.
6. Remove the green chillies and set them aside. Remove the mixture from heat and add it to a [food processor](https://amzn.to/3o68l64). Blend until smooth. You can also use an [immersion blender](https://amzn.to/3pcRrDQ) for this step.
7. Return the mixture to the [pan](https://amzn.to/3F0cvEn), along with the reserved chillies. Then add the chickpeas, cilantro, 1/2 cup water, and bring it all to a simmer.
8. Sprinkle the dish with kalonji seeds and cover the pan with the lid slightly ajar. Lower the heat even more and maintain a gentle bubble. Cook until the liquid reduces, about 12-15 minutes. 
9. Season the channa Masala with salt, to taste, and garnish with cilantro to serve. 

#### CHANA MASALA INSTANT POT INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Heat the ghee in an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3ttlual) on saute mode. Add 1 tsp of the kalonji seeds, the cumin seed, and the green chillies. Cook until ingredients begin to sputter.

3. Next, add the garlic and ginger. Stir to combine.
4. In a small bowl, combine chili powder, turmeric, and garam masala. Stir the spices into the mixture until it becomes fragrant, about 30 seconds.
5. Add the tomatoes and allow the gravy to simmer for 5 minutes.

### ABOUT THE MEAL

Like many popular dishes in Indian and Pakistan, recipes for chana masala or channa masala vary from region to region. This chana masala recipe is similar to those found in Northern India or Pakistan. I hope you enjoy this channa masala recipe our family loves.

#### Chana Masala Main Ingredients:

* [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW) 

* [Kolongi Seeds](https://amzn.to/3jMZUuh)

* [Cumin Seeds](https://amzn.to/3vBeR8i)

* Thai Green Chili

* Red Onion

* Garlic 

* Ginger

* Spices: I used [kashmiri chili powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC), [turmeric powder](https://amzn.to/3vyvAZK), homemade [garam masala](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/pakistani_garam_masala/), and [coriander powder](https://amzn.to/3lwbJ92) to flavor the channa. 

* Tomato

* Chickpeas: We used canned simply out of convenience, but you can also use dry chickpeas. If you go that route, you will need to soak the chickpeas for 6-24 hours and increase the cooking time for this recipe, about 1-2 hours.

* Cilantro

* Salt

* Garam Masala: India is a large country with varying sub-cultures. As a result, Indian food differs from region to region. The same thing applies to specific spices used as well. For this reason, I suggest making garam masala at home, so you can control the amount of each spice used and cater it specifically to your preferences. Here is one of the [garam masala](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/pakistani_garam_masala/) spice blends we use in our home. If you choose to buy garam masala, I suggest getting [Rani](https://amzn.to/3m1KWBX).

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [heavy-bottomed pan](https://amzn.to/3F0cvEn) with a lid or an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3ttlual)

* A small bowl

* A [food processor](https://amzn.to/3o68l64), [blender](https://amzn.to/2SrI06u), or an [immersion blender](https://amzn.to/3pcRrDQ)

#### Can I modify this recipe to make vegan chana masala?

All you have to do to make this recipe vegan is to use a different oil in place of the ghee. I suggest using [grapeseed oil](https://amzn.to/3cLwWYG).

#### What can I serve with chana masala? 

Roti, [paratha](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/paratha/), poori or puri, chapati, or basmati rice are the most popular. 

#### Can I freeze chana masala? 

You sure can. First, allow the dish to cool, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. Channa masala will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stovetop, and enjoy. 

#### Other variations of channa masala? 

* Black Chana Masala or Kala Chana Masala  
* Aloo Chana Masala 
* Punjabi Chana Masala
