#### CHANA MASALA STOVE - TOP INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Warm ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tsp of the kalonji seeds, cumin seed, and chilis. Cook until ingredients begin to sputter.
2. Add onion,  and cook until the onions brown and caramelize. This step may take a while, and that’s okay. You are building flavor for the dish. Be sure to stir the onions frequently to prevent them from burning. 
3. Next, add the garlic and ginger and stir to combine.
4. In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, turmeric, and garam masala. Stir the spices into the pan mixture until it becomes fragrant, about 30 seconds.
5. Add the tomatoes and allow the mixture to simmer for about 5 minutes.
6. Remove the green chilis and set them aside. Then remove the entire mixture from heat and put it into a food processor, blend until smooth.
7. Return the mixture to the pan, along with the reserved chilis. Then add the chickpeas, cilantro, 1/2 cup water, and bring it to a simmer.
8. Sprinkle the dish with kalonji seeds and cover the pan with the lid slightly ajar. Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle bubbling. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has reduced, about 12-15 minutes.
9. Season with salt, to taste, and garnish with cilantro. 

#### CHANA MASALA INSTANT POT INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Heat the ghee in an Instant Pot on saute mode. Add 1 tsp kalonji seed, cumin seed, and chilis. Cook until they begin to sputter.
2. Add the onion, stirring frequently, until the onions brown and caramelize. This step may take a while, that’s okay. You are building flavor for the dish.
3. Next, add the garlic and ginger and stir to combine.
4. In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, turmeric, and garam masala. Stir the spices into the pan mixture until it becomes fragrant, about 30 seconds.
5. Add the tomatoes and allow the mixture to simmer for about 5 minutes.
6. Remove the green chilis and set them aside. Then remove the entire mixture from heat and put it into a food processor, blend until smooth.
7. Return the mixture to the pan, along with the reserved chilis. Then add the chickpeas, cilantro, 1/2 cup water, and bring it to a simmer on saute mode.
8. Sprinkle the dish with kalonji seeds and secure the lid. Set the Instant Pot to manual high pressure and cook for 10 minutes. 
9. Season with salt, to taste, and garnish with cilantro. Serve with long-grain basmati rice, paratha, or naan.

### ABOUT THE MEAL


#### Chana Masala main ingredients:

* Chickpeas: We used canned simply out of convenience. You can use dry chickpeas, but you will need to soak them for 6-24 hours and increase the cooking time for this recipe, about 1-2 hours.

* Onion and Tomato: There is nothing quite like the spicy gravy made from slow-cooking the onion and tomatoes, along with the ginger, garlic, and green chilis. This process and these ingredients bring so much flavor to the dish. 

* Garam Masala: India is a vast country with varying sub-cultures, and as a result, Indian food differs from region to region. The same thing applies to specific spices used as well. For this reason, I suggest making garam masala at home, so you can control the amount of each spice used in the mix and cater it specifically to your preferences. Here is the [garam masala](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/pakistani_garam_masala/) we make in our home. If you choose to go the store-bought route, I suggest [Rani](https://amzn.to/3qNCcQk), Spice House, or Penzey’s garam masala.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [heavy-bottomed pan](https://amzn.to/3bbyk6E) with a lid or an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3ttlual)

* A small bowl

* A [food processor](https://amzn.to/3o68l64) or [blender](https://amzn.to/2SrI06u)

#### Can I modify this recipe to make vegan chana masala?

All you have to do to make this particular recipe vegan, is to use another oil in place of the ghee. I suggest using [grapeseed oil](https://amzn.to/3cLwWYG).

#### What can I serve with chana masala? 
Roti, paratha, poori (puri), chapati, or basmati rice are the most popular. 

#### Can I freeze chana masala? 

First allow the dish to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. Chana masala will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stovetop, and enjoy.
