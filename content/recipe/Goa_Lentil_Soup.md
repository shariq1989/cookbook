#### STOVE-TOP DIRECTIONS 

1. In a large saute pan, add the coconut oil and onion. Cook on low heat until the onions brown and caramelize. This step may take a while, but that's okay. You are building flavor for the dish. 
2. When the onions caramelize, add the garlic, ginger, chilis, and kosher salt. Allow the mixture to cook for about 1 minute. 
3. Next, add the mustard seed, turmeric, coriander, and fennel. Stir for 1 minute until the mixture is fully incorporated. 
4. Add the water and then whisk in the coconut milk. Stir in the lentils and bring the mixture to a boil. 
5. Reduce the heat and cover the pan with a lid. Cook on medium heat for 30-40 minutes. Be sure to check the dal every so often and give it a quick stir to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. 
6. Stir in spinach and return to a simmer, about 3-4 minutes. 
7. Off heat, add the last 1 tbsp of ginger, lime juice, and kosher salt to taste. Stir well. 
8. Garnish with lime wedges and serve with long-grain basmati rice.
