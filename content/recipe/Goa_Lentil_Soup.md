#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 tbsp Coconut Oil 
* 1 Yellow Onion, diced 
* 4 Garlic Cloves, finely diced  
* 2 tbsp Ginger, minced, divided
* 3-5 Boriya Chili, depending on desired spice level
* Kosher Salt to taste 
* 2 tsp [Black Mustard Seed](https://amzn.to/2Q4RC60)
* 2 tsp [Turmeric](https://amzn.to/3qQ6ZvL), ground  
* 1 tsp [Coriander](https://amzn.to/30WR1W5), ground
* 1 tsp Fennel, ground
* 3½ cup Water 
* 1 can Full-Fat [Coconut Milk](https://amzn.to/3cEP2vg) 
* 1 cup [Red Lentils](https://amzn.to/3qmuduc) (Masoor Daal) 
* 6 cup Spinach 
* 2 tsp Lime Juice 
* Lime Wedges for garnish

#### STOVE-TOP DIRECTIONS 

1. Gather 1 cup of masoor dal. Rinse it in a colander and set it aside. 
2. In a large saute pan, add the coconut oil and onion. Cook on low heat until the onions brown and caramelize. This step may take a while, but that's okay. You are building flavor for the dish. 
3. When the onions caramelize, add the garlic, ginger, chilis, and kosher salt. Allow the mixture to cook for about 1 minute. 
4. Next, add the mustard seed, turmeric, coriander, and fennel. Stir for 1 minute until the mixture is fully incorporated. 
5. Add the water and then whisk in the coconut milk. Stir in the lentils and bring the mixture to a boil. 
6. Reduce the heat and cover the pan with a lid. Cook on medium heat for about 25-30 minutes. Be sure to check the dal every so often and give it a quick stir to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Overcooked dal is mushy and undercooked dal is crunchy, much like a seed. You want the dal to be tender, but still have substance.
7. Stir in spinach and return to a simmer, about 3-4 minutes. 
8. Off heat, add the last 1 tbsp of ginger, lime juice, and kosher salt to taste. Stir well. 
9. Garnish with lime wedges and serve with long-grain basmati rice.

#### INSTANT POT DIRECTIONS 

1. Gather 1 cup of masoor dal. Rinse it in a colander and set it aside. 
2. In an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ), add the coconut oil and the onion. Cook on saute mode until the onions brown and caramelize. This step may take a while, but that's okay. You are building flavor for the dish. 
3. When the onions caramelize, add the garlic, ginger, chilis, and kosher salt. Allow the mixture to cook for about 1 minute. 
4.  Next, add the mustard seed, turmeric, coriander, and fennel. Stir for 1 minute until the mixture is fully incorporated. 
5. Add the water and then whisk in the coconut milk. Add the lentils and bring the mixture to a boil on saute mode. 
6. Secure the lid and set the Instant Pot to manual high pressure for 15 minutes with a quick release. 
7. Remove the lid and stir in spinach. Return to a simmer on saute mode, about 3-4 minutes. 
8. Add the last 1 tbsp of ginger, lime juice, and kosher salt.  Stir well. 
9. Garnish with lime wedges and serve with long-grain basmati rice.

#### Is Goa red dal vegetarian? Is red Goa dal vegan? 

This dish is both vegetarian and vegan-friendly. 

#### Can I freeze the Goa red dal?
Yes, first allow the Goa red dal to cool and gather several freezer-safe resealable plastic bags. Scoop a small amount of dal into each plastic bag, making sure to leave a few inches of space so the dish can expand if needed. Squeeze out as much air as you can before sealing the bag. Moong Dal will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your side dishes.
