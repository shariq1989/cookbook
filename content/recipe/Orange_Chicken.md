#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Marinade:

* 2 tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar
* 4 tbsp Sugar
* 2 large Eggs Whites, lightly beaten
* 1 tsp Sesame Oil
* 3 tbsp Soy Sauce
* 4 tbsp White Vinegar
* 1 tbsp Orange Zest 

For the Fried Chicken:

* 2 lb Chicken Thighs, skinless and boneless, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 1/2 cup Cornstarch
* 1/4 cup Flour
* 2 qt Canola Oil

For the Dish:

* 1 tbsp Corn Starch
* 2 tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar
* 1/4 cup Water
* 1 tsp Sesame Oil
* 3 tbsp Soy Sauce
* 1/2 cup Sugar
* 1/2 cup White Vinegar
* Orange Zest 
* 1 1/2 tbsp Ginger Paste
* 2 tsp Garlic, minced
* 1 tsp Toasted Sesame Seeds 

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a large bowl, combine the ingredients for the marinade: rice wine vinegar, sugar, beaten egg whites, sesame oil, soy sauce, white vinegar, and orange zest. Stir the mixture until the sugar fully dissolves. Add chicken to the bowl and stir to coat, cover. Marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, set 2 wire racks into 2 rimmed baking sheets.
3. In another large bowl, stir together the cornstarch and flour.
4. Remove the marinated chicken and leave it to drain in a colander for about 1-2 minutes.
5. Add 1/3 of the chicken to the cornstarch mixture and toss to coat completely, pressing the pieces into the mixture. Shake the pieces to remove any excess cornstarch and transfer them to one of the prepared racks. Repeat with the remaining chicken.
6. In a large dutch oven, over medium heat, warm the oil to 375 degrees. Add half of the coated chicken in a single layer and cook until both sides turn light brown, about 3-7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to the other prepared wire rack.
8. Allow the oil to reach 375 degrees again and repeat with the remaining chicken. 
9. Prepare a heavy-bottomed pan and add the ginger and garlic pastes, cook for about 10 seconds.
10. Next add the rice wine vinegar, water, sesame oil, soy sauce, sugar, white vinegar, and orange zest. Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring frequently, so the mixture does not burn or stick, about 5 minutes. 
11. Reduce the heat and stir in the cornstarch (1 tbsp) and then add the fried chicken to the mixture. Stir to combine.
12. Garnish with the toasted sesame seeds and serve with jasmine rice.
