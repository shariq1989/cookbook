Preparation Time: 45 minutes 

Cooking Time: 40 minutes

Cuisine: Chinese, American

#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Marinade:

* 1 tbsp [Rice Wine Vinegar](https://amzn.to/3feHUZc)
* 3 tbsp Sugar
* 2 large Eggs Whites, lightly beaten
* 1 tsp [Sesame Oil](https://amzn.to/3b72o2v)
* 2 tbsp Soy Sauce
* 2 tbsp White Vinegar
* 1 tbsp Orange Zest 

For the Fried Chicken:

* 2 lb Chicken Thighs, skinless and boneless, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 1/2 cup Cornstarch
* 1/4 cup Flour
* 2 qt Canola Oil

For the Sauce:

* 1 1/2 tbsp Ginger Paste
* 2 tsp Garlic, minced
* 3 tbsp [Rice Wine Vinegar](https://amzn.to/3feHUZc)
* 1/2 cup Fresh Orange Juice, 1-2 oranges
* 1 tsp [Sesame Oil](https://amzn.to/3b72o2v)
* 3 tbsp Soy Sauce
* 1/2 cup Sugar
* 2 tbsp White Vinegar
* Orange Zest 
* 1/2 tsp Red Chili Flakes
* 1 tbsp Corn Starch
* 1 tsp Toasted Sesame Seeds 

#### DIRECTIONS 

For the Chicken: 

1. In a large bowl, combine the ingredients for the marinade: rice wine vinegar, sugar, egg whites, sesame oil, soy sauce, white vinegar, and orange zest. Stir the mixture until the sugar fully dissolves. Add the chicken to the bowl, stir to coat, and cover. Let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, set the wire racks into the rimmed baking sheets.
3. In another large bowl, mix the corn starch and flour.
4. Remove the marinated chicken and leave it to drain in a colander for about 1-2 minutes.
5. Add 1/3 of the chicken to the cornstarch mixture. Toss to coat and press the pieces into the mix. Shake each piece to remove any excess corn starch and transfer them to one of the prepared racks. Repeat with the remaining chicken.
6. In a large dutch oven, over medium heat, warm the oil to 375 degrees. Add half the coated chicken in a single layer and cook until both sides turn a light brown, about 3-7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to the other wire rack.
7. Allow the oil to reach 375 degrees again and repeat with the remaining chicken. 

For the Sauce: 

1. Prepare a heavy-bottomed pan with oil and add the ginger paste and garlic. Cook for 10 seconds, until aromatic
2. Next, add rice wine vinegar, fresh orange juice, sesame oil, soy sauce, sugar, white vinegar, red chili flakes, and orange zest. Allow the mixture to simmer for about 5 minutes. 
3. Reduce the heat and stir in the corn starch (1 tbsp), then add the fried chicken to the mixture. Stir to combine. If you plan to freeze leftovers, keep the chicken and sauce separate. Instead, add the chicken to the individual plates and pour the sauce overtop. Stir to combine on each plate. 

To Serve: 

1. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and serve the orange chicken with jasmine rice. 

### ABOUT THE MEAL

On the occasion that I go out of town without my family, my husband and children have a little tradition of getting Panda Express, which they will continue to eat as leftovers the entire time I am away. Because of this delightful custom, the kids regularly ask me when I plan to leave them alone with baba. Needless-to-say, I felt compelled to make myself irreplaceable, hence this recipe. Now mama can bring Panda Express to them. 

#### Where does orange chicken originate?

Orange chicken is famous in the United States, thanks in large part to Panda Express. Orange chicken includes flavors inspired by cooking in the Hunan Province in China, but the orange chicken we know in the U.S. is Chinese-American.  

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Chicken: I use chicken thighs since dark meat is more flavorful than white meat. You can use chicken breast if you prefer.

* Oranges: I love using fresh ingredients whenever possible, but that is especially true of this dish. I love the sweet, citrus flavor real oranges produce in the sauce.  Pro-Tip: Taste your oranges before squeezing to ensure they are sweet instead of sour. You could use store-bought orange juice, but I feel that fresh oranges are the way to go. 

* Rice Wine Vinegar and White Vinegar: Part of cooking well is learning to balance flavors. I have zero professional culinary experience, but books like [The Food Lab](https://amzn.to/3ezumr7) have helped me grow in this area. The oranges deliver sweetness to the sauce; we counter that with vinegar. I am telling you that this sauce wouldn't be the same without the bite vinegar brings with it. Some people use only rice wine vinegar. I prefer to use a combination of rice wine and white vinegar. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* 2 Large bowls
* 2 Rimmed baking sheets 
* 2 Wire racks 
* A colander
* A [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3qK1Llq)
* A [food thermometer](https://amzn.to/38BMn44) 
* A slotted spoon 
* A heavy-bottomed pan 

#### Can I make this recipe gluten-free?

Yes, replace the all-purpose flour with [chickpea flour](https://amzn.to/30F0Vf2) or add more cornstarch. Also, substitute [tamari sauce](https://amzn.to/30F0uBo) in place of soy sauce.

#### Can I freeze orange chicken?

Yes, if you plan to freeze the orange chicken, be sure to keep the chicken and sauce separate except when dishing up individual plates. Freeze the sauce and chicken separately in freezer-safe containers. When youâ€™re ready to eat, let them defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, reheat the chicken in the oven and warm the sauce in a pan. Toss the chicken with the sauce and enjoy.
