3. Heat a heavy pan over medium high heat. Add the cooking oil, onion, garlic, and green onion. Stir with a wooden spoon for 3 to 4 minutes until it’s a little brown and fragrant. Stir in beef for about 2 to 3 minutes until the beef is thoroughly cooked.
4. Add 2 cups stock.

Cut the tubes of soft tofu in halves and add to the soup. Add the seasoning mixture and mix, gently breaking the tofu with the wooden spoon.
Cover and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes until bubbling. Your sundubu-jjigae is then ready to serve!


Cook the Kimchi in a skillet until soft. (You could do this in the pot where you will make this jjigae. Do this only if the pot is big enough to manoeuvre around.
