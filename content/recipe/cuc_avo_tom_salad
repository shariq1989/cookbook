### ABOUT THE SIDE

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Cocktail Cucumbers: You can use regular cucumbers for this and cut them up more, but our family just loves the mini cocktail cucumbers. I personally think that they are more crisp than the regular ones and I love the crunch they add to the salad. 

* Avocado 

* Tomatoes

* Olive Oil and Lime
