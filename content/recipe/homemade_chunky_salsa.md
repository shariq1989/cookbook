### ABOUT THE SIDE

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Roma Tomatoes 

* Jalapenos: When making this salsa for large groups of people, jalapenos are my pepper of choice. If you love jalapenos but want to make the salsa with more spice, simply do not remove the seeds and membranes when chopping them. Oftentimes, I prefer to use a serrano chili to add a bite to the salsa. 

* Red Onion 

* Avocados

* Spices: I like the mixture of salt, pepper, cumin, and garlic powder to flavor the dish. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large bowl
