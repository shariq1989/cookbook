### ABOUT THE SIDE

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Roma Tomatoes: Romas are great for making salsa because they have more meat and fewer seeds than other types of tomatoes, which makes the salsa less watery. 

* Jalapenos: When making this salsa for large groups of people, jalapenos are my pepper of choice. If you love jalapenos but want to make the salsa with more spice, leave e the seeds and membranes intact when chopping them.  I prefer to use a serrano chili to add a bite to the salsa. 

* Red Onion 

* Avocados 

* Spices: I like the mixture of salt, pepper, cumin, and garlic powder to flavor the salsa. You could also add some Mexican oregano. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large bowl 

#### How do I store leftover salsa? 

On the off chance that you have leftover salsa, store it in the refrigerator for 2-4 days.
