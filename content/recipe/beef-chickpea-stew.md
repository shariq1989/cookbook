* 2 tbsp Cumin, ground
* 1 tsp Green Cardamom, ground, green casting removed
* 1 tsp Cinnamon, ground
* Kosher Salt, to taste 
* Black Pepper, coarse ground, to taste
* 1 lb Short Rib, boneless, trimmed of fat, and cut into 1-inch pieces 
* 1 Garlic Head 
* 2 tbsp Butter, salted
* 1 Large Yellow Onion, diced 
* 2 tbsp Tomato Paste
* 1 tsp [Marmite](https://amzn.to/3cjVzes)
* 6 cup Water
* 1 tbsp Beef [Better Than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/3HERalr) 
* 1 cup Baby Carrots
* 1- 15½ oz can of Chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* 3 cup Baby Spinach
* 2 tbsp Lemon Juice and Zest, about 2 lemons 
* Plain Yogurt, for garnish
  
#### Instructions 

1. Combine the paprika, turmeric, cumin, cardamom, cinnamon, 2 tsp salt, and 1 tsp pepper in a small bowl. Reserve half of the spice mixture and massage the beef with the remaining spices. Set aside. 
2. Cut off and discard the top third of the garlic head, leaving the head intact. Set aside. 
3. In a [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3DIlKbp), over medium-high heat, melt butter. Add onion and cook until they become translucent and soften for about 5 to 8 minutes. 
4. Add tomato paste, Marmite, and the reserved spice mixture. Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add the water and bring the pot to a boil over high heat, then add the beef, and garlic head, cut side down. 
5. Cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for 1 hour, adjusting the heat to maintain a gentle bubble. Add the carrots and continue simmering, partially covered, for another 30 minutes. 
6. Using tongs, remove the garlic head and squeeze over the stew to release the cloves. Whisk to blend. 
7. Stir in the chickpeas and spinach. Cook until spinach wilts, about 5 minutes.

### About the Meal 

Have you ever taken stock of your pantry or fridge and pretended you were on Chopped? No? Me neither. Okay, maybe that is a thing I do, but in any case, that's how this recipe came to be. I originally made the stew with chuck roast before deciding on short rib. I also fine-tuned the dish with a few tasty additions along the way to make our Moroccan-inspired beef and chickpea stew. It is protein-rich, with layers and layers of flavor that recapture the warm spices and savory dishes Morrocco is known for. In the end, I hope you enjoy this satisfying stew our family loves.
 
#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Warm Spices: I use sweet paprika, turmeric, cumin, green cardamom, and cinnamon to flavor the dish. 

* Boneless Short Rib: Short rib tenderizes well and adds rich flavor. Other options are chuck roast, lamb, or goat, which are incredible variations to this soup.  

* Garlic 

* Onion 

* Tomato Paste 

* [Marmite](https://amzn.to/3cjVzes): Marmite has a distinct flavor profile, think soy sauce, but as a paste (kind of), and I absolutely love adding it to soups and stews like this one. 

* Beef [Better Than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/3HERalr) 

* Carrots 

* Chickpeas: The chickpeas complement the beef well in this stew. 

* Spinach 

* Lemon Juice 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A small bowl 
* A [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/38xuVO8) or [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rRWIjZ)

#### Can I make beef and chickpea stew in the Instant Pot? 

For the Instant Pot:  

1. Combine paprika, turmeric, cumin, cardamom, cinnamon, 2 tsp salt, and 1 tsp pepper in a small bowl. Reserve half of the spice mixture and massage the beef with the remaining spices. Set aside.  
2. Cut off and discard the top third of the garlic head, leaving the head intact. Set aside. 
3. In an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rRWIjZ), melt butter on saute mode. Add onion and cook until they become translucent and soften for about 5 to 8 minutes. 
4. Add tomato paste, Marmite, and the reserved spice mixture. Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add the water and bring to a boil on saute mode, then add the beef, and garlic head, cut side down. 
5. Secure the lid and set the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rRWIjZ) to manual low pressure for 50 minutes with a quick release.  
6. Add the carrots, secure the lid, and set the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rRWIjZ) to manual low pressure for 3 minutes with a quick release. 
7. Using tongs, remove the garlic head and squeeze over the stew to release the cloves. Whisk to blend. 
8. Stir in the chickpeas and spinach. Cook until spinach wilts, about 5 minutes. 
9. Add the lemon juice, lemon zest, season the stew with salt and pepper, and garnish with yogurt. 
10. Serve with a steaming side of couscous, marinated kalamata olives, and enjoy!

#### Can I make a vegetarian version of this stew? Could I make it Vegan?

With a few modifications, you can easily create a delicious vegetarian or vegan stew using a similar flavor profile to this one. 

* Vegetarian: Use potatoes instead of beef or double the chickpeas, and use [Vegetable Better Than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/3nHa7vJ) as a substitute.

* Vegan: Use potatoes instead of beef or double the chickpeas. You should also replace the butter with your favorite vegan butter and use [Vegetable Better Than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/3nHa7vJ) instead. 

#### What sides pair well with Morrocan beef stew with chickpeas? 

I love this stew with couscous and marinated kalamata olives. You could also pair it with aromatic basmati rice, sweet potatoes, or butternut squash.

#### What toppings go on this stew? 

I enjoy the creaminess of using plain yogurt to garnish, but you could top the stew with cilantro, golden raisins, or fresh mint. I think using any one of these or a combination of the toppings would be incredibly tasty. 

#### Can I freeze stew? 

You sure can. First, allow the dish to cool completely, and then add the stew to a freezer-safe container or bag. It will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm on the stovetop, and enjoy!
