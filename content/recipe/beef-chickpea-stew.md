### About the Meal 

This Moroccan-inspired beef and chickpea stew is flavorful and hearty. The development of this recipe came about by a happy mistake. Have you ever taken stock of your pantry and refrigerator and pretended you were on the show Chopped? No? Me neither. Okay, maybe that is a thing I do, but in any case, that is how this recipe came to be. I originally made it with chuck roast before deciding to use short rib instead. I also fine-tuned the dish with a few tasty additions along the way. We hope you enjoy this stew our family loves.
 
#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Warm Spices: I use sweet paprika, turmeric, cumin, green cardamom, and cinnamon to flavor the dish.

* Garlic 

* Onion 

* Tomato Paste

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A small bowl 
* A [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/38xuVO8) or [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rRWIjZ)

#### Is this stew vegetarian? Is it Vegan?

One of the main ingredients of this stew is beef, so the answer to that question would appear to be no. However, with a few modifications, you can easily create a delicious vegetarian and vegan stew. 

* Vegetarian: Use potatoes instead of beef or double the chickpeas and then use [Vegetable Better Than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/3nHa7vJ) as a substitute.

* Vegan: Use potatoes instead of beef or double the chickpeas. You can replace the butter with your favorite vegan butter and then use [Vegetable Better Than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/3nHa7vJ) as a substitute. 

#### Can I freeze beef and chickpea stew? 

You sure can. First, allow the dish to cool completely, and then add the stew to a freezer-safe container or bag. It will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm on the stovetop, and enjoy!
