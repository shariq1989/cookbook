#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Biscuits: 

* 2 1/3 cups [Almond Flour](https://amzn.to/2POPsYC)
* 2 tsp Baking Powder
* 1/2 tsp Kosher Salt
* 2 Eggs
* 6 tbsp Butter, melted, divided  
* 1/4 cup Sour Cream 
 
For the Gravy: 

* 1 lb Ground Breakfast Sausage 
* 2 tbsp Butter
* 1 cup Heavy cream
* 1 cup Water
* 1 1/2 tbsp Pepper, coarse ground
* 1/2 tsp Kosher Salt
* 1 tsp Garlic Powder
* 1 tsp Corn Starch

#### INSTRUSTIONS

For the Biscuits: 
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Crack the eggs into a small bowl and whisk them together. Set aside. 
3. In a large bowl, mix the almond flour, baking powder, garlic powder, and salt. Then, stir in the reserved egg mixture, 5 tbsp melted butter, and the sour cream.
4. Using an ice cream scoop or similar-sized spoon, scoop out the dough. Use your hands to form a rounded biscuit shape and then sightly flatten the top with your fingers and place them on the rimmed baking sheet. Repeat until the dough is gone. 
5. Glaze the top of the biscuits with the remaining melted butter. 
6. Bake for 15 minutes, until the biscuits are firm and golden. 

For the Gravy: 

1. While the biscuits are baking, brown the sausage in a large saute pan over medium heat for 4-5 minutes. Remove the sausage from the pan using a slotted spoon and set it aside. 
2. Return the pan to medium heat and add the heavy cream, water, pepper, salt, and garlic powder. Then, gently whisk in the corn starch. 
3. Bring the mixture to a gentle bubble, stirring occasionally to thicken the gravy. Reduce heat to low and return the meat to the pan. Stir to combine, cover, and simmer for another 5 minutes. 

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

My mama was a server in a mom-and-pop diner for as long as I could remember growing up. One thing the diner did well is their biscuits and gravy. Loving the biscuits and gravy, but wanting fewer carbs, this recipe was born.

#### Can I freeze the biscuits and gravy?

Yes, but do so separately. This is one of my favorite things about making this recipe. I often double the recipe for the biscuits to freeze them, so we have quick and easy breakfast, or dinner rolls the next time around. Allow the biscuits to cool completely, and add them to a freezer-safe bag. Do the same with any leftover gravy. The biscuits and the gravy will freeze for up to 3 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, warm the biscuits in the oven or microwave and warm the gravy on the stovetop. Enjoy!
