Servings: 10 Biscuits <!--more-->

Preparation Time: 10 minutes

Cooking Time: 20 minutes

Cuisine: American

#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Biscuits: 

* 2 1/3 cups Almond Flour
* 2 tsp Baking Powder
* 1/2 tsp Kosher Salt
* 2 Eggs
* 6 tbsp Butter, melted, divided  
* 1/4 cup Sour Cream 
 
For the Gravy: 

* 1 lb Ground Breakfast Sausage 
* 1 cup Heavy cream
* 1 cup Water
* 1 1/2 tbsp Coarse Ground Pepper 
* 1/2 tsp Kosher Salt
* 1 tsp Garlic Powder
* 1 tsp Corn Starch

#### INSTRUSTIONS

For the Biscuits: 
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Crack the eggs into a small bowl and whisk them together. Set aside. 
3. In a large bowl, mix the almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Then, stir in the reserved egg mixture, 4 tbsp melted butter, and sour cream.
4. Using a spoon, scoop out the dough. Use your hands to form a rounded biscuit shape and sightly flatten the top with your fingers. Repeat until all the dough is gone. 
5. Glaze the tops of the biscuits with the remaining butter. 
6. Bake for about 15 minutes, until firm and golden. Cool on the baking sheet.

For the Gravy: 

1. While the biscuits are baking, brown the sausage in a large saute pan over medium heat for 4-5 minutes. Remove the sausage from the pan and set it aside. 
2. Return the pan to medium heat and add in the heavy cream, water, pepper, salt, and garlic powder. Then, gently whisk in the corn starch. 
3. Bring the mixture to a gentle bubble, stirring occasionally to thicken the gravy. Reduce heat to low and return the meat to the pan. Stir to combine, cover, and simmer for another 5 minutes.
