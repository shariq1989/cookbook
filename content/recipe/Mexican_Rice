#### STOVE-TOP DIRECTIONS 



#### INSTANT POT DIRECTIONS

1. Add the tomatoes and diced onion to a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth. 
2. Pour the mixture into a sauce pan. Stir in the chicken broth, salt, and cumin and bring to a boil over medium heat. Meanwhile, toast the rice.
Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add the rice and sauté, stirring frequently, until lightly toasted and golden, about 5 minutes. Add the jalapeños and cook until softened, about 2 minutes, lowering the heat as needed. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds more.
Pour the boiling tomato mixture over the rice and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and gently fluff the rice with the fork. Cover again and set aside to steam for 10 minutes. Add the cilantro and lime juice and fluff again to combine. Taste and season with more salt as needed. Serve with lime wedges.

Yes, it is, with a few modifications. 

* Vegetarian: Use potatoes instead of beef, or double the chickpea amount.

You sure can. First, allow the dish to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container. The beef and chickpea stew can freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrig
