#### STOVE-TOP DIRECTIONS 

1. Add the tomatoes and diced onion to a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth. 
2. Pour the mixture into a saucepan. Stir in the vegetable to chicken broth, salt, and cumin and bring to a boil over medium heat.
3. While the tomato mixture is coming to a boil, warm oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add the rice and toast until the rice becomes golden, about 5 minutes. 
4. Add the jalapeños and garlic and cook until they soften for about 2 minutes. 
5. Pour the boiling tomato mixture over the rice and stir to combine. 
6. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender about 10-15 minutes. 
7. Remove the rice from heat and fluff it with a fork. Cover with the lid and set it aside steam for 5 minutes before serving. 
8. To serve, add the cilantro and lime juice and fluff again to combine. Garnish with lime wedges and enjoy.  

#### INSTANT POT DIRECTIONS

1. Add the tomatoes and diced onion to a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth. 
2. Pour the mixture into a saucepan. Stir in the vegetable to chicken broth, salt, and cumin and bring to a boil over medium heat.
3. While the tomato mixture is coming to a boil, warm oil in a [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rRWIjZ) over medium heat until shimmering. Add the rice and toast until the rice becomes golden, about 5 minutes. 
4. Add the jalapeños and garlic and cook until they soften for about 2 minutes. 
5. Pour the boiling tomato mixture over the rice and stir to combine. 
6. Secure the lid and set to manual low pressure for 4-6 minutes. You want the liquid to be full absorbed by the rice.

8. To serve, add the cilantro and lime juice and fluff again to combine. Garnish with lime wedges and enjoy.

#### Can I freeze the Mexican rice? 

You sure can. First, allow the dish to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container. The Mexican rice can freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator. To serve, warm it in the microwave for 5 minutes and enjoy.
