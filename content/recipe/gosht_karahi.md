Servings: 3-4 <!--more-->

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1/2 cup [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW), divided
* 1 1/2 lb Goat, bone-in, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 1 medium Yellow Onion, sliced
* 3 large Tomatoes, pureed 
* 2 tsp Ginger Paste
* 2 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 1/2 Package Laziza or Shan [Karahi Masala](https://amzn.to/2MYzcmx), this will make for mild spice. 
* 1 tsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC) 
* 1 tsp [Kolongi Seeds](https://amzn.to/3jMZUuh) 
* 2 Green Chilis, split lengthwise
* 1 cup Cilantro, chopped, divided, for garnish 
* 1/4 cup Fresh Ginger, cut into batons, for garnish

#### INSTRUCTIONS 

1. In a heavy-bottomed pan, warm the ghee (1/4 cup) over medium-low heat.
2. Add onion and cook until they become brown and caramelized. This step can take some time, that’s okay. You are building flavor for the dish. 
3. While the onion is cooking, add the tomatoes to a food processer and blend until smooth. Set aside.
4. Raise the heat to medium-high, add the remaining ghee (1/4 cup), and stir in the goat. Fry the meat, until the color begins to change.
5. Add the ginger paste and garlic, stirring regularly, so nothing burns, about 2 minutes.
6. Next, stir in the pureed tomato, Karahi masala, Kashmiri chili powder, kalonji seeds, 1/3 cup cilantro, and green chilis. Cover the pan and lower the heat to maintain a simmer. 
7. Let the karahi cook for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally, to ensure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan. At the 1 hour mark, check the goat for tenderness by attempting to separate the meat from the bone using a fork. The meat should easily pull. If not, allow the meat to simmer until it reaches the desired tenderness.
8. Garnish with ginger batons, cilantro, and extra green chilis. Serve with naan or long-grain basmati rice.
