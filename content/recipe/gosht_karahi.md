### How to Make Karahi Gosht 

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1/2 cup [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW), divided
* 1 1/2 lb Goat, bone-in, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 1 medium Yellow Onion, sliced
* 3-4 Roma Tomatoes, pureed 
* 2 tsp [Ginger Paste](https://amzn.to/3lic68c) 
* 2 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 1/2 Package Laziza Karahi Masala 
* 1 tsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC) 
* 1 tsp [Kolongi Seeds](https://amzn.to/3jMZUuh) 
* 2 Thai Green Chilis, split lengthwise
* 1 cup Cilantro, chopped, divided, for garnish 
* 1/4 cup Fresh Ginger, cut into batons, for garnish

#### INSTRUCTIONS 

1. In a [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3o0Z68E) or [karahi](https://amzn.to/3BuoEPL), warm 1/4 cup ghee over medium-low heat.
2. Add onions and cook until they become brown and caramelized. This step can take some time, that’s okay. You are building flavor for the dish. 
3. While the onion is cooking, add the tomatoes to a [blender](https://amzn.to/3D3VsPB) or [food processer](https://amzn.to/3xvwCXS). Process until smooth, and set aside.
4. Increase the heat to medium-high, add the remaining ghee, and stir in the goat. Continue to fry until the color of the goat changes.
5. Add the ginger paste and garlic, and then cook for about 2 minutes.
6. Next, stir in the reserved pureed tomato, Laziza karahi masala, Kashmiri chili powder, kalonji seeds, 1/3 cup cilantro, and green chillies. Cover the pan and lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. 
7. Let the karahi cook for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally, to ensure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan. At the 1 hour mark, check the goat for tenderness by attempting to separate the meat from the bone using a fork. The goat should easily pull. If not, allow the meat to simmer until it reaches the desired tenderness.
8. Garnish with fresh ginger, cilantro, and green chillies. Serve with naan or long-grain basmati rice.

### ABOUT THE MEAL

Karahi is a Pakistani dish that gets its name from the wok-like pan it is made in. The traditional karahi was cooked over an open flame, low and slow, but the true beauty of a good karahi is in its rich tomato base and fragrant toppings like cilantro, ginger, and green chillies. There are so many variations of karahi, so I hope you enjoy this quick and simple chicken karahi or chicken kadai recipe our family loves.

#### What ingredients do I need for this meal?

* [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW) 

* Goat: If your local grocery store doesn't carry it, where can you find goat? I suggest going to a local Indian, Mexican, or Asian market near you and they should carry it. 

* Onion: Onions are not traditionally included in a karahi, but I prefer the flavor of the masala with the onion included. 

* Tomatoes: Tomatoes are the base for the rich, flavorful gravy. I use Roma tomatoes because they tend to have less moisture.

* [Ginger Paste](https://amzn.to/3lic68c) 

* Garlic

* Karahi Masala: I use Laziza Karahi Masala; I have tried others, but I always return to this one. I attempted to link it for you, but Amazon doesn't carry the karahi masala for that brand. You can usually find this Laziza karahi masala at a local Asian or Indian market. If you're not able to get your hands on that specific masala, try [Shan's](https://amzn.to/3dfIHat).

* [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC) 

* [Kolongi Seeds](https://amzn.to/3jMZUuh) 

* Thai Green Chillies 

* Cilantro 

* Fresh Ginger 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3o0Z68E) or [karahi](https://amzn.to/3BuoEPL)
* A [blender](https://amzn.to/3D3VsPB) or [food processer](https://amzn.to/3xvwCXS)

#### Can I make chicken karahi spicy? Can I lower the spice?

This is a mild karahi gosht recipe. If you prefer a more spicy dish, use 3/4 of the Laziza Karahi Masala instead, and add more Thai green chillies. If you feel this the original recipe will be too spicy for you, I suggest using 1/4 of the package and skipping the extra chillies alltogether.

#### Can I freeze karahi gosht?

You sure can. First, allow the karahi to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. Karahi will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your sides.

#### What other types of karahi are there?

* Balochi Karahi
* Charsi Karahi: This isn’t necessarily a type of karahi, but it’s a famous rendition hailing from a restaurant in Peshawar, Pakistan.
* Green Karahi
* Karahi Dhaba-Style
* Lahori Karahi
* Punjabi Karahi
* Shashlik Karahi
* White Karahi
