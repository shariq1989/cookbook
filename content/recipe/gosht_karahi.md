### HOW TO MAKE KARAHI GOSHT

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1/2 cup [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW), divided
* 1 1/2 lb Goat, bone-in, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 1 medium Yellow Onion, sliced
* 3 large Tomatoes, pureed 
* 2 tsp Ginger Paste
* 2 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 1/2 Package Laziza Karahi Masala 
* 1 tsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC) 
* 1 tsp [Kolongi Seeds](https://amzn.to/3jMZUuh) 
* 2 Green Chilis, split lengthwise
* 1 cup Cilantro, chopped, divided, for garnish 
* 1/4 cup Fresh Ginger, cut into batons, for garnish

#### INSTRUCTIONS 

1. In a heavy-bottomed pan or [karahi](https://amzn.to/3BuoEPL), warm 1/4 cup ghee over medium-low heat.
2. Add onions and cook until they become brown and caramelized. This step can take some time, that’s okay. You are building flavor for the dish. 
3. While the onion is cooking, add the tomatoes to a food processer and blend until smooth. Set aside.
4. Increase the heat to medium-high, add the remaining ghee, and stir in the goat. Continue to fry until the color of the goat changes.
5. Add the ginger paste and garlic, and then cook for about 2 minutes.
6. Next, stir in the pureed tomato, Karahi masala, Kashmiri chili powder, kalonji seeds, 1/3 cup cilantro, and green chilis. Cover the pan and lower the heat to maintain a simmer. 
7. Let the karahi cook for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally, to ensure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan. At the 1 hour mark, check the goat for tenderness by attempting to separate the meat from the bone using a fork. The goat should easily pull. If not, allow the meat to simmer until it reaches the desired tenderness.
8. Garnish with ginger batons, cilantro, and extra green chilis. Serve with naan or long-grain basmati rice.

### ABOUT THE MEAL

Karahi is a Pakistani dish that gets its name from the wok-like pan it is made in. The traditional karahi was cooked over an open flame, low and slow, but the true beauty of a good karahi is in its rich tomato base and fragrant toppings like cilantro, ginger, and green chilis. There are so many variations of karahi, so I hope you enjoy this quick and simple chicken karahi or chicken kadai recipe our family loves.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Goat

* Tomatoes: Tomatoes are the base for the rich, flavorful gravy. I use Roma tomatoes because they tend to have less moisture.

* Onions: Onions are not traditionally included in a karahi, but I prefer the result with onion added.

* Ginger and Garlic

* Karahi Masala: I use Laziza Karahi Masala; I have tried others, but I always return to this one.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A heavy-bottomed pan or [karahi](https://amzn.to/3BuoEPL)

#### Can I make chicken karahi spicy? Can I lower the spice?
This recipe is for a mild karahi gosht. If you prefer a more spicy dish, use 3/4 of the Laziza Karahi Masala. If you feel this will be too spicy for you, I suggest using 1/4 of the package.

#### Can I freeze Karahi Gosht?
You sure can. First, allow the karahi to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. Karahi will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your sides.

#### What other types of karahi are there?

* Balochi Karahi
* Charsi Karahi: This isn’t necessarily a type of karahi, but it’s a famous rendition hailing from a restaurant in Peshawar, Pakistan.
* Green Karahi
* Karahi Dhaba-Style
* Lahori Karahi
* Punjabi Karahi
* Shashlik Karahi
* White Karahi
