### ABOUT THE SIDE 

The only thing you need to make guacamole is a few ripe avocados and salt; everything that follows is extra but oh so tasty. Here is how our family likes to prepare it. 

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Avocado: You will want to choose large avocados for this recipe, and the riper, the better. You can check for ripeness by gently pressing the outside of the avocado. If there is no give, the avocado is not ripe. If there is a little give, the avocado is ripe. If there is too much give, the avocado may be past ripe. 

* Red Onion: I prefer the strong flavor of red onion. If it is too strong for you, rinse the chopped onion under the water and pat them dry before adding it to the guacamole. 

* Limes: There is a notable flavor difference between fresh lime juice and bottled.  I choose fresh whenever possible. 

* Jalapeno Peppers: I usually use finely diced jalapenos, but if I want something a bit spicier, I reach for a serrano pepper. 

* Tomatoes: Tomatoes are usually a key ingredient in guacamole. However, Shariq is not a fan of uncooked tomatoes, so we skip over them. If you prefer to include tomatoes, I suggest using Roma tomatoes. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A small bowl

#### How should I store my guacamole?

This guacamole keeps well in the refrigerator if stored properly. Add the guacamole to an airtight container. I leave the pit in the guacamole and squeeze a little bit of fresh lime juice over the top to preserve the freshness. Place Saran wrap on top of the guacamole and press it down, so the plastic covers any exposed guacamole. Cover the container with the lid; it will keep up to 3-5 days.
