#### ABOUT THE MEAL 

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Chicken: We used a whole butterflied chicken for this recipe because, in my opinion, that is the tastiest and most effective way to make a chicken. You could also use this rub and recipe to make chicken thighs, legs, or a combination of the two. I wouldn't recommend using chicken breast because they are more likely to come out dry. You should still use the suggested cooking time for this recipe. 
– The safe cooking temperature for chicken is 160 degrees.
