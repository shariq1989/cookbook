### ABOUT THE MEAL 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal? 

* Ground Beef: In Urdu, the word "qeema" means minced. In this case, we are making beef qeema or minced beef. One step you don't want to skip is taking the time to break up the meat. You can do this with a spatula, but I highly recommend using a [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/2OoDZhv), plus they are really satisfying to use.

* Qeema Masala: I am usually a fan of making masalas from scratch, but this .is a quick and easy meal. I suggest using [Lazika Qeema Masala](https://amzn.to/2Ohfras).

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* 2 [heavy-bottomed pans](https://amzn.to/3EXs3ZG)
* A [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/2OoDZhv)

#### Can I make qeema vegetarian? Can I make it vegan?

Yes, I like The Ultimate Beefless Ground from Gardein. Use the Beefless Ground in place of meat. To make the recipe vegan, you will also need to also replace the ghee. I suggest using grapeseed oil.

#### Can I freeze qeema?

You sure can. First, allow the qeema to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. To prevent freezer burn, you can also layer plastic wrap over the container before securing the lid. Qeema will freeze for up to 2 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, let it defrost in the frige overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your sides.
