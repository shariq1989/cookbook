#### INGREDIENTS 

For Gosht: 

* 1 1/2 Lb. Goat, cut into 1-2in. pieces (rinse the meat before cooking) 
* 2 Medium Yellow Onions, thinly sliced
* 1/4 Cup Garlic Cloves
* 4 in. Ginger, sliced
* 3/4 Cup Full-Fat Yogurt 
* 2-1/2 Tbsp. Coriander Powder 
* 2 Tsp. Red Chilli Powder (Not American Chili Powder) 
* 1/2 Tsp. Turmeric Powder
* Salt, to taste
* 1/3 Cup Ghee
* 4 Tbsp. Ghee 
* 2 Tbsp. Cilantro, chopped

For Whole Spices:

* 6 Dry Red Chilis
* 2 Bay Leaves
* 1-1/2 in. Cinnamon Stick
* 5 Cloves
* 5 Whole Black Peppercorns
* 5 Green Cardamom Pods
* 2 Black Cardamom Pods
* 1/2 Tsp. Nutmeg, ground

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. To begin, wash the goat and add it to an Instant Pot or pressure cooker with 1 Cup Water and 1 Tsp. of Salt. Cook on high pressure for 40 min. with a quick release (This is for high-elevation. You can reduce cooking time for lower elevation). 
2. While meat is cooking, heat oil (1/2 Cup) in a heavy bottomed pan and add whole spices until they begin to crackle.
3. Add garlic cloves and ginger slices. Saute until golden.
4. Mix in the onions and fry until they are soft and translucent. At this point you can add the goat when it is finished cooking.
5. Add in yogurt and salt and let it cook on high heat until the yogurt leaves water on the sides.
6. Cover the pan and allow mixture to simmer, about 5 min.
7. Stir in the coriander powder, turmeric, red chilli powder and mix together.
8. Adjust to high heat again and fry until oil leaves from the sides. Keep adding ghee while frying (about 4 Tbsp.).
9. Once the oil seperates, check the salt and adjust if needed.
10. Slowly the goat will thicken and turn deep brown in color. 
11. Garnish with cilantro and fresh ginger slices. 
12. Serve with naan or rice.
