### ABOUT THE MEAL

This quick and easy Yellow Thai Curry is made with chicken and fresh vegetables and is ready in under 30 minutes. The yellow curry paste, or nam prik gaeng karee, is a main ingredient and flavors the curry with a sweet and mild taste and the perfect bit of spice. We hope you enjoy the best yellow curry recipe our family loves.

#### Yellow Curry Ingredients: 

* Chicken: I prefer boneless and skinless chicken thighs; you could also use chicken breast.

* [Coconut Milk]((https://amzn.to/3uukipb)): Full-fat coconut milk is the only option here to optimize the flavor and consistency of the curry. 

* Vegetables: I use onions, potatoes, zucchinis, and carrots in this curry. 

* Yellow Curry Paste: My absolute favorite yellow Thai curry paste is [Maesri](https://amzn.to/2XUUbLX). [Mae Ploy Yellow Curry Paste](https://amzn.to/2Y0tx4C) is a solid alternative. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [heavy-bottomed pan](https://amzn.to/3kQSCYw) 

#### Can I freeze Thai curry?

You sure can. First, allow the curry to cool completely. Then, add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. When youâ€™re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your sides.
