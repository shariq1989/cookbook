### About the Meal

#### Yellow Curry Ingredients: 

* Chicken: I prefer boneless and skinless chicken thighs; you could also use chicken breast.

* Vegetables: I use onions, potatoes, zucchinis, and carrots in this curry. 

* Yellow Curry Paste: The best yellow Thai curry paste out there is [Maesri Yellow Curry Paste](https://amzn.to/2XUUbLX). [Mae Ploy Yellow Curry Paste](https://amzn.to/2Y0tx4C) is a solid alternative.

#### Can I freeze Thai curry?

You sure can. First, allow the curry to cool completely. Then, add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. When youâ€™re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your sides.
