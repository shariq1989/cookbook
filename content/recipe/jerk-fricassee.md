### How to Make Jerk Chicken Fricasse 

#### Ingredients  

For the Jamaican Jerk Seasoning:

* 1 tbsp Onion Powder
* 1 tbsp Garlic Powder
* 2 tsp Cayenne Pepper
* 2 tsp Paprika
* 2 tsp Salt
* 1 tbsp Black Pepper, coarse ground 
* ½ tsp Red Pepper Flakes
* ½ tsp Cumin, ground
* ½ tsp Nutmeg, ground
* 1 tbsp Cinnamon, ground
* 1 tsp Thyme, dried
* 1 tbsp Parsley, dried

For the Fricassee:

* 4 tbsp Jamaican Jerk Seasoning, divided 
* 3 lb Chicken Thighs, boneless and skinless, trimmed and patted dry
* 1 tbsp Avocado Oil 
* 1 medium Yellow Onion, thinly sliced 
* 1/2 Green Bell Pepper, thinly sliced 
* 4 Scallions, thinly sliced, whites and greens reserved separately 
* 2 tbsp [Gochujang](https://amzn.to/3al2a8Y)
* 1 tbsp Soy Sauce 
* 1 tbsp Lime Juice 

#### Instructions 

1. In a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3E4wi4O), combine the ingredients for the jerk seasoning and coat the chicken with 2 tbsp. 
2. In a [saute pan](https://amzn.to/3hIzyKw) over medium-high heat heat the oil, and then add half of the chicken, top side down, and cook until golden brown, 5-8 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate. Repeat until all the chicken has had a chance to brown. 
3. When the meat is done cooking and reserved, lower the heat and add the onion, scallion whites, [gochujang](https://amzn.to/3al2a8Y), and the remaining 2 tbsp of jerk seasoning to the pan. Cook over medium heat until onions soften and brown.
4. Stir in soy sauce, lime juice, and 1 1/2 cup of water, bring to a simmer, scraping up any brown bits.
5. Return the chicken to the skillet, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for about 12 minutes.
6. Transfer the chicken to a serving platter and then cook the liquid over medium-high heat, stirring regularly until the gravy thickens, 7-10 minutes.
7. To serve, pour the mixture over the chicken and garnish with scallion greens.

### About the Meal 

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Jerk Seasoning: I use a homemade combination of spices, but you could also go the store-bought route with [Coleman's](https://amzn.to/3G0yuuP). If you decide to make the seasoning homemade, it will last for 2 months in a sealed mason jar. 

* Chicken Thighs: I use boneless and skinless chicken thighs, but fricassee is traditionally made with a broken-down, whole chicken, or thighs and legs that are bone-in and skin-on. Whatever cut of chicken you end up with, be sure to adjust the cooking time accordingly. The safe temperature for chicken is 160 degrees. 

* Avocado Oil 

* Onion 

* Green Bell Pepper

* Scallions 

* [Gochujang](https://amzn.to/3al2a8Y): Gochujang isn't a common ingredient in a Caribbean fricassee, but I use it instead of ketchup, and it is phenomenal. 

* Soy Sauce 

* Lime 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3E4wi4O)
* A [saute pan](https://amzn.to/3hIzyKw) with a lid
