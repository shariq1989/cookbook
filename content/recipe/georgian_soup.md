#### STOVE-TOP INSTRUCTIONS 

For the Chicken Broth: 

1. Tie the stems of the cilantro and dill bundles, then trim the leaves, reserving ¼ cup of each for garnish. 
2. Cut off and discard the top third of the garlic head, leaving the head intact. 
3. In a large pot or dutch oven, combine the chicken, stems, garlic, and the remaining broth ingredients. Bring to a boil and then reduce to medium-low. Simmer until chicken is tender, about 45 minutes.
4. Remove the lid and scoop up the garlic head. Set aside. 
5. Transfer the chicken to a baking sheet to cool. Shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces, discarding the skin, bones, and cartilage. 
6. Strain the broth into another pot and discard the solids. 
7. Using tongs, squeeze the garlic head into the broth, and whisk to combine. 

For the Soup: 

1. Wipe out the empty pot or use a new one, add butter, carrots, onions, and salt. Set over medium heat and cook, stir occasionally, until the onions begin to brown, about 10-12 minutes. Add the vermouth, scraping up any brown bits. Cook for about 1-2 minutes. 
2. Add flour and stir for 1 minute to build a roux, and then add soy sauce. 
3. Add 2 cups of broth and stir until smooth, then add the remaining broth and bring to a simmer. 
4. In a medium bowl, whisk the yolks together. Continue whisking while slowly adding 1 cup of hot broth from the pot. Then, whisk in the lemon juice, and return the mixture to the pot, whisk to combine. 
5. Add the reserved chicken and any accumulated juices. Do not simmer once the eggs are in the mixture. 
6. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and red chili flakes.
7. Garnish the soup with fresh cilantro and dill.

### ABOUT THE MEAL

Who else loves a good chicken soup? Whether the onset of fall or a seasonal cold, having a go-to chicken soup is pretty necessary at this point. If I had to choose only one, this soup would be mine. Like other Georgian dishes, the addition of lemon and fresh dill create the tartness of the chikhirtma, which is balanced by the creaminess of the egg yolks.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken: For this recipe, I prefer using a whole chicken because it makes for a great-tasting broth. You can also use any combination of legs, thighs, and breasts to make your soup.  If you choose to go this route, you can use store-bought chicken stock to flavor the soup. Since you're skipping the broth-making process, I would still take a moment to allow the chicken broth to cook with the cilantro and dill stems, garlic, onions, and whole spices so you don't lose any of the flavors. 

* Vegetables: I stuck with the more traditional use of carrots, onion, garlic, to build a tasty roux for the chikhirtma.  

* Egg Yolks: Using egg yolks thickens and flavors the soup while balancing the tartness of the other flavors like lemon and dill. 

* Lemon Juice: Lemon juice provides the right amount of acid, and lends the traditional tangy, Georgian flavor to the soup. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3o7zDem) or Instant Pot (https://amzn.to/3u9c6L1)

#### How do I store the leftovers?

Leftover soup will keep in the fridge for 3-4 days in a covered container. To extend the shelf-life, you can freeze the soup to use again at another time. First, allow the dish to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. The chikhirtma will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm the soup on a stove or in the microwave, and enjoy.
