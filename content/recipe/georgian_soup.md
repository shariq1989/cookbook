* 10 cup Water 
* 1 large White Onion, quartered 
* 3 tsp Kosher Salt 
* 1 tsp Peppercorns 
* ½ tsp Coriander Seeds 
* 1 tsp Red Pepper Flakes 
* 1 Cinnamon Stick 
* 2 Bay Leaves 

For the Soup: 

* 3 tsp Salted Butter 
* 5 medium Carrots, chopped 
* 1 large White Onion, diced 
* 1 tsp Kosher Salt  
* ½ cup Dry Vermouth 
* 1 tsp Flour

#### STOVE-TOP INSTRUCTIONS 

For the Chicken Broth: 

1. Tie the stems of the cilantro and dill bundles, then trim the leaves, reserving ¼ cup of each for garnish. Cut off and discard the top third of the garlic head, leaving the head intact. 
2. In a large pot, combine the chicken, stems, garlic, and the remaining broth ingredients. Bring to a boil and reduce to medium-low. Simmer until chicken is tender, about 45 minutes.
3. Remove the lid and scoop up the garlic head. Set aside. 
4. Transfer the chicken to a baking sheet and cool. Shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces, discarding the skin, bones, and cartilage. 
5. Strain the broth into another pot or bowl, discarding the solids. Using tongs, squeeze the garlic head into the broth; the tender cloves should pop out of their skins. Whisk into the broth. 

For the Soup: 

1. Wipe out the empty pot, add butter, carrots, onions, and salt. Set over medium heat and cook, stir occasionally, until the onions begin to brown, about 10-12 minutes. Add the vermouth, scraping up any brown bits. Cook for about 1-2 minutes. 
2. Add flour and stir for 1 minute, and then add the soy sauce. 
3. Add 2 cups of broth and stir until smooth, then add the remaining broth. Bring to a simmer. 
4. In a medium bowl, whisk the yolks. Continue whisking while slowly adding 1 cup of hot broth from the pot. Whisk in the lemon juice, and return the mixture to the pot, whisk to combine. 
5. Add the chicken and any accumulated juices. Do not simmer once the eggs are in the mixture. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and red chili flakes.
6. Garnish the soup with cilantro, dill, and red chili flakes.

### ABOUT THE MEAL

Who doesn't love a good chicken soup? Whether the fall or a winter-time sickness, having a go-to chicken soup is pretty much required at this point. If I had to choose, this would be mine. Like many Georgian dishes, chikhirtma's use of lemon and dill lends a tartness to the soup that is blanced by the creaminess of the egg yolks. With the bit of heat that comes from the red chili flakes, you are looking a perfect go-to chicken soup

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken: For this recipe I use a whole chicken, but you could use any combination of legs, thighs, and breat to make your soup. Just be sure to use store-bought chicken stock to flavor the soup if you choose to go that route. 

* Vegetables: I stuck with the more traditional use of carrots, onion, garlic, to build the roux for the chikhirtma.  

* Egg Yolks: Using egg yolks thickens and flavors the soup, while balancing the tartness of the other flavors like lemon and dill. 

* Lemon Juice: Lemon juice provides the right amount of acid, and allows the soup to maintain the more traditional Georgian flavors. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3o7zDem) or Instant Pot (https://amzn.to/3u9c6L1)

#### Can I freeze chikhirtma?

Yes, first allow the dish to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container or Ziploc bag. The chikhirtma will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm the soup on a stove and enjoy.
