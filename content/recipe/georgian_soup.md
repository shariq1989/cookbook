* 1 tsp Red Pepper Flakes 
* 1 Cinnamon Stick 
* 2 Bay Leaves 

For the Soup: 

* 3 tsp Salted Butter 
* 5 medium Carrots, chopped 
* 1 large White Onion, diced 
* 1 tsp Kosher Salt  
* ½ cup Dry Vermouth

#### STOVE-TOP INSTRUCTIONS 

For the Chicken Broth: 

1. Tie the stems of the cilantro and dill bundles, then trim the leaves, reserving ¼ cup of each for garnish. Cut off and discard the top third of the garlic head, leaving the head intact. 
2. In a large pot, combine the chicken, stems, garlic, and the remaining broth ingredients. Bring to a boil and reduce to medium-low. Simmer until chicken is tender, about 45 minutes.
3. Remove the lid and scoop up the garlic head. Set aside. 
4. Transfer the chicken to a baking sheet and cool. Shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces, discarding the skin, bones, and cartilage. 
5. Strain the broth into another pot or bowl, discarding the solids. Using tongs, squeeze the garlic head into the broth; the tender cloves should pop out of their skins. Whisk into the broth. 

For the Soup: 

1. Wipe out the empty pot, add butter, carrots, onions, and salt. Set over medium heat and cook, stir occasionally, until the onions begin to brown, about 10-12 minutes. Add the vermouth, scraping up any brown bits. Cook for about 1-2 minutes. 
2. Add flour and stir for 1 minute, and then add the soy sauce. 
3. Add 2 cups of broth and stir until smooth, then add the remaining broth. Bring to a simmer. 
4. In a medium bowl, whisk the yolks. Continue whisking while slowly adding 1 cup of hot broth from the pot. Whisk in the lemon juice, and return the mixture to the pot, whisk to combine. 
5. Add the chicken and any accumulated juices. Do not simmer once the eggs are in the mixture. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and red chili flakes.
6. Garnish the soup with cilantro, dill, and red chili flakes.  

#### INSTANT POT INSTRUCTIONS

For the Chicken Broth:

### ABOUT THE MEAL

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken: For this recipe you I use a whole chicken, but you could just use thighs or breasts to make the broth as well. 

* Vegetables: I use carrots, onion, garlic, 

* Egg Yolks: Using egg yolks thickens and flavors the soup, while adding tasty fat. 

* Lemon Juice: Lemon juice provides just the right amount of acid for this dish, and I personally love the sour notes it lends to the soup.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large pot or Instant Pot

#### Can I freeze the chikhirtma?

Yes, first allow the dish to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container or Ziploc bag. The chikhirtma will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm the soup on a stove and enjoy.
