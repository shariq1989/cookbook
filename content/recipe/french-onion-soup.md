### How to Make French Onion Soup 

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 4 tbsp Unsalted Butter, plus more for the baguette slices
* 3 lb Vadalia Onion, thinly sliced, about 5-6 large onions
* ½ tsp Baking Powder 
* Kosher Salt, to taste 
* Black Pepper, coarse ground, to taste  
* ½ cup Dry Sherry 
* 2 qt Water 
* 2 tbsp [Beef Better Than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/2Pk82Hf)
* 2 Thyme Sprigs 
* 1 Bay Leaf 
* 1 tsp [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/3jMYZdj) 
* 4 small Baguette slices
* 1 medium Garlic Clove, punctured, for the toast
* 1 lb [Gruyere Cheese](https://amzn.to/3aZfe2E), grated 

#### INSTANT POT INSTRUCTIONS 

For the Soup:  

1. Melt butter in an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) on saute mode. Add the onions and baking powder, and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until onions soften and begin to release liquid, about 3 minutes. 
2. Secure the lid on the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) and cook on manual high pressure for 20 minutes with a quick release. 
3. Continue cooking the onions with the lid off until the liquid inside reduces and the onions become brown and sticky, about 5 minutes. Be sure to stir constantly to prevent burning. 
4. On saute mode, add sherry and bring the mixture to a simmer, scraping up any brown bits left behind. Cook until the alcohol smell is mostly gone.
5. Next, add water, Better Than Bouillon, thyme sprigs, and a bay leaf. Bring to a simmer for 10 minutes.
6. Discard the thyme sprigs and bay leaf, and stir in the fish sauce before baking the soup. 

To Serve: 

1. Move the oven rack to the top position and preheat the broiler on high.  
2. Butter the baguette slices and rub them with a punctured garlic clove. 
3. Spoon broth into the bottom of the [oven-safe bowls](https://amzn.to/3FUapFL), sprinkle with the shredded Gruyère, and top it with the baguette slices.  
4. Next, spoon more broth over the top of the bread and cover with the remaining Gruyère. 
5. Set the bowls onto a [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3D0iUxo) and broil until the cheese melts and brown spots begin to appear.

#### ABOUT THE MEAL

French onion soup is a timeless classic and happens to be on the list of my favorite comfort foods. It's the perfect meal for those chilly days and makes you want to curl up with a warm bowl of this soup. Our French onion soup recipe is easy to make and can be made in the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) or stove-top. It stays true to traditional French onion soup and can be vegetarian with a few modifications. I hope you enjoy this tasty French onion soup our family loves.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal? 

* Butter: Butter is the tastiest and most French approach to caramelize the onions. Because this is the most critical step to develop the flavor of French onion soup, I encourage you to splurge for higher quality butter, like [Kerrygold](https://amzn.to/3c5Q433). 

* Onion: You can use any onion, but I recommend using Vidalia. I prefer their sweetness and the ease with which they caramelize. French onion soup is made with thinly sliced yellow onions. 

* Baking Powder 

* Salt 

* Black Pepper 

* Dry Sherry 

* Thyme Sprigs 

* A Bay Leaf

* Beef [Better Than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/2Pk82Hf)

* [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/3jMYZdj)

* Bread: You can use any bread, but I highly recommended slicing up a delicious baguette, buttering that thing up, rubbing it with a garlic clove, and using that to top your soup. 

* Garlic 

* Cheese: The classic choice is Gruyere, and I do not deviate from that. It is the more expensive alternative, but so worth it when making this soup. However, if you're looking for a budget-friendly cheese, you can substitute it with swiss, asiago, or parmesan.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe? 

* An [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ)
* 4 [oven-safe bowls](https://amzn.to/3FUapFL)
* A [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3D0iUxo)
* A [cheese grater](https://amzn.to/3cWDJPK)

#### Is French onion soup vegetarian? Is it vegan? 

Cooked traditionally, no. However, with a few easy modifications it can be, 

* Butter: Use olive oil or vegan butter to caramelize the onions. 
* Broth: Use a mushroom-based bouillion to highlight the other flavors in the soup, like [Mushroom Better than Bouillion](https://amzn.to/31jWnhA). 
* Use either Worcestershire sauce or [marmite](https://amzn.to/3xv5qIC) in place of the fish sauce. 
* If making vegan, reach for vegan cheese instead of the Gruyere. 

#### Can I freeze French onion soup? 

You sure can. First, allow the soup to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. French onion soup can freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm the soup on a stove-top and then skip to the "to serve" instructions in this recipe. Enjoy.
