#### INSTRUCTIONS

In a gallon size resealable bag, combine lime juice, crushed garlic, orange juice, cilantro, salt, pepper, vegetable oil, jalapeno, and vinegar. Squeeze it around to mix it up.
Put the entire flank steak into the resealable bag. Seal it up tight. Make sure all the meat is exposed to the marinade, squishing the bag around to coat. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight.
Heat an outdoor grill to high heat.
Remove the flank steak from the marinade, and discard excess marinade. Cook on the grill for 7 to 10 minutes per side.
Once done, remove from heat and let rest 10 minutes. Slice against the grain, and serve.
If you donâ€™t have access to an outdoor grill, you can always cook your carne asada indoors on the stovetop.  A stovetop will work the same way as a grill. Heat a large heavy skillet (preferably cast iron) over high heat. Cook the meat for about 5 to 7 minutes per side, or until the desired level of doneness is reached.
### ABOUT THE MEAL

#### What kind of meat do you use for carne asada? 

For carne asada, you will need a thinly sliced beef. Out of convieniece, the most popular meat used to make carne asada here in the U.S. is flank, or skirt steak. Out of the two, I recommend using skirt steak. However, for best results I suggest heading on over to a local carniceria if you have one and purchasing something called flap steak or ranchera de res. Apart from the local carniceria I have only been able to find non-marinated flap steak at Whole Foods, but it is usually quite expensive.    

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Toppings: No street taco is complete without red onion and cilatro. I like to finish our tacos off with homemade salsa to complete the dish. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A grill or grill pan 
* A 9x 13 baking dish 
* A pair of tongs 

#### How do I cut the carne asasa for the tacos? 

First, allow the meat to rest. I leave mine in alumninium foil so it retains some of the moisture and stays warm. When cutting the meat, be sure to cut against the grain. This means cutting against the natural lines of the meat, instead of parallel with them. I encourage you to do this because it keeps the meat from becoming chewy.
