### ABOUT THE MEAL

#### What kind of meat do you use for carne asada? 

For carne asada, you will need a thinly sliced beef. Out of convieniece, the most popular meat used to make carne asada here in the U.S. is flank, or skirt steak. Out of the two, I recommend using skirt steak. However, for best results I suggest heading on over to a local carniceria if you have one and purchasing something called flap steak or ranchera de res. Apart from the local carniceria I have only been able to find non-marinated flap steak at Whole Foods, but it is usually quite expensive.    

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Toppings: No street taco is complete without red onion and cilatro. I like to finish our tacos off with homemade salsa to complete the dish. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A grill or grill pan 
* A 9x 13 baking dish 
* A pair of tongs
