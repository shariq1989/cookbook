#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a small bowl, combine ingredients for the jerk seasoning and set aside (any leftovers will store for up to 3 months in a sealed mason jar).
2. In another bowl, combine 2 tbsp jerk seasoning with salt and pepper and season the chicken with the mixture.
3. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil until shimmering. Add half of the chicken, skin down, and cook until golden brown, 7-10 minutes.
4. Transfer the chicken, skin-up, to a plate. Repeat until all of the chicken has had a chance to brown. 
5. Pour off and discard all but 2 tbsp fat from the skillet.
6. Add the onion, scallion whites, Gochujang Sauce, and remaining jerk seasoning to the pan. Cook over medium heat until onions soften and turn lightly brown.
7. Stir in soy sauce, lime juice, and 1 cup of water, bring to a simmer, scraping up any brown bits at this time.
8. Return the chicken to the skillet, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for about 20 minutes.
9. Transfer the chicken to a serving platter. Cook the liquid over medium-high heat, stirring regularly until the liquid thickens, 7-10 minutes.
10. Remove from heat, taste, and season with salt and pepper.
11. Pour the mixture over the chicken, garnish it with the scallion greens, and serve with lime wedges.
