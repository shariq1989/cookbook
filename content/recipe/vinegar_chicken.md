#### INGREDIENTS 

* 3 lbs Chicken Thighs, bone-in and skin-on
* 1 1/2 tsp Turmeric
* 6 tbsp Olive Oil, divided
* Kosher Salt and Pepper, to taste 
* ½ cup White Wine Vinegar 
* 1½ cup Green Olives, crushed 
* 2-4 Garlic Cloves, minced 
* 1 tbsp Fresh Parsley, chopped 

#### INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. 
2. Place the chicken into a bag with olive oil and turmeric. Mix well. 
3. In a prepared baking dish, add the chicken thighs and season them with salt and pepper. 
4. Place the chicken into the dish, skin-side up, then pour vinegar over and around the chicken and place it in the oven. Bake without flipping for 25-35 minutes. 
5. In a small bowl, combine the crushed olives, garlic, parsley, and the remaining olive oil (3 tbsp), as well as 2 tbsp of water.
6. Once the chicken is cooked, remove the baking dish and transfer the chicken thighs to a serving tray, leaving behind the juices. 
7. Pour the olive mixture into the baking dish. Using a spoon, gently scrape up the bits of chicken left behind, letting the olive oil mixture mingle with the rendered fat. When mixed well, pour the dressing over the chicken to serve.  

### ABOUT THE MEAL

This recipe was created by Alison Roman. Her dish is so bright and flavorful and I wanted to share the same recipe with the modifications we made for our family. You can eat the chicken with or without the olive dressing, though I don't know why you would want to skip it.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken: I use chicken thighs, but feel free to use drumsticks or wings if you prefer. Bone-in and skin-on will give you the best flavor. If you're feeding a crowd, why not use a whole chicken? Just be sure that you adjust the cooking time depending on your choice. The safe cooking temperature for chicken is 160 degrees.

* Vinegar: Vinegar adds tanginess to the dish and balances the fat in this recipe.

* Olives and Olive Oil: What I love most about this dish is the flavor from the fat of the oil, olives, and chicken with the bite of vinegar and fresh herbs. 

* Turmeric: Not only does this spice flavor the dish, but it brings the vibrant yellow color. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A bag 
* A prepared baking dish 
* A small bowl
