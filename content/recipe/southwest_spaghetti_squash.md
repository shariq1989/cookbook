#### INSTRUCTIONS

For the Baked Spaghetti Squash: 

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 
2. Place the halved spaghetti squash on a [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3oXRaVd). Drizzle both sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Turn them over so that the insides are facing down on the baking sheet. 
3. Bake for 40 minutes until you can easily pierce the flesh with a fork.  
4. Remove from the oven and allow the squash to cool. Then, use a fork fluff to separate the strands.

For the Southwest Filling: 

1. While the squash is baking, warm oil in a [saute pan](https://amzn.to/3wWoZtf) over medium heat. 
2. Add the ground beef and break it up with a meat chopper; cook until browned and heated through for about 10 minutes. Then add the onions and cook until they begin to soften. 
3. Next, add the taco seasoning, chipotle pepper powder, and Mexican oregano; stir to combine. 
4. Stir in the tomatoes, kale, and black beans. Cook for another 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. 
5. When the spaghetti squash is done baking and cooled, use a fork to fluff and separate the strands from the squash. Then add the strands to a large mixing bowl. 
6. Combine the reserved meat mixture with the squash in the bowl, and return the mixture to the squash casing or another baking dish. 
7. Cover the mixture with cheese and bake for another 10 minutes. 
8. Garnish with cilantro, cabbage, onion, chillies, or sour cream; serve with a side salad, cilantro lime rice, or [Mexican rice].
