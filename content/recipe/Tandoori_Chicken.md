#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 tbsp Olive Oil 
* 1 tsp Coriander, ground
* 1 tsp Cumin, ground
* 1 tsp Turmeric
* 1 tsp Cayenne Pepper
* 1 tbsp [Garam Masala](https://amzn.to/3u0tvEX)
* 1 tbsp Paprika
* 1/2 tsp Red Food Powder, optional
* 1 cup Plain Full-Fat Yogurt 
* 2 tbsp Lemon Juice, plus lemon wedges to garnish
* 2 tbsp Garlic and Ginger Paste 
* 1 tsp Kosher Salt
* 8 Chicken Drumsticks, skin-on, bone-in 

#### INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a food processor, blend olive oil, coriander, cumin, turmeric, cayenne powder, garam masala, paprika, red food powder, yogurt, lemon juice, and garlic and ginger paste, and salt until smooth. 
2. Mix the tandoori paste and chicken together in a large bowl. Toss until the chicken is fully coated. Cover and marinate in the fridge for 24 hours. 
3. Preheat the grill by setting all burners to high, about 15 minutes. 
4. Turn off the rightmost burner and maintain a grill temperature of 325-350 degrees.
5. Oil the grates and cook the drumsticks on the hottest side of the grill, skin-down. Cook until they become blistered, about 5 minutes.
6. Flip the drumsticks and cook for another 4-6 minutes. 
7. Move the drumsticks to the cool side of the grill (rightmost burner that you turned off) and cook the skin-side up for 25 minutes.
8. Flip the drumsticks and continue cooking, until the chicken has reached over 170 degrees, about 20-30 minutes. 
9. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes before serving. 
10. Garnish with lemon wedges and serve with [raita](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/raita/).
