Let the egg cook undisturbed for 30 seconds, and gently push the eggs from one side of the [pan](https://amzn.to/3cS6RI4) to the other, incorporating the eggs with the vegetables. 
5. Increase the temperature to high and add the reserved chilled rice, the remaining 1 tbsp butter, soy sauce, and oyster sauce; stir to combine. Allow the rice to cook with the rest of the ingredients for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
