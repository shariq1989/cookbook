Servings: 8 <!--more-->

Preparation Time: 10 minutes

Cooking Time: 50 minutes 

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 cup [Moong Dal](https://amzn.to/3rCtNAB), rinsed   
* 1 1/2 cup water 
* 1 tsp Kosher salt, to taste
* 1 1/2 tbsp [turmeric](https://amzn.to/3rWz3iD), ground 
* 1 tbsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC) 
* 1/2 tsp [Garam Masala](https://amzn.to/3u0tvEX)
* 1 large Tomato, diced and pureed 
* 1 tbsp Ginger, freshly grated 
* 3 Garlic Cloves, minced 
* Cilantro, chopped, for garnish 

For the Tadka: 

* 1 tbsp [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW) 
* 2 Thai Green Chilis, split lengthwise 
* 2-3 Boriya Chilis, dried 
* 1 tsp Cumin Seed
* 1/2 tsp [Black Mustard Seed](https://amzn.to/3eNP1rC)
* 3-4 Fresh Curry Leaves   
* 1 1/2 large Red Onion, thinly sliced

#### INSTANT POT DIRECTIONS 

1. Set an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) to saute mode and warm the ghee. 
2. Add the boriya chili, cumin seed, mustard seed, and curry leaves. 
3. Once they begin to sputter, add the onion and green chilis. Fry, stirring often, until the onions brown and caramelize. Reserve half of the onion mixture and set aside at room temperature. 
4. Add the ginger, garlic, turmeric, chili powder, and garam masala to the Instant Pot, give it a quick stir, and then add the tomatoes. Let the mixture simmer, about 2 minutes. 
5. Next, add the rinsed moong dal, salt, and water to the other ingredients in the Instant Pot. Stir well. 
6. Secure the lid and set the Instant Pot to manual high pressure. Cook for 20 minutes. This cooking time is for high elevation. Reduce cooking time for lower elevation. Allow the Instant Pot to naturally release for 5 minutes and then do a quick release. 
7. Stir the dal to check the consistency. If it is thicker than desired, add 1/2 cup HOT water before serving. 
8. Garnish with the reserved onion mixture, cilantro, and extra green chilis, if desired. Serve with long-grained Basmati rice. 

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

Growing up, Shariq ate this meal regularly throughout the week; in his own words, he hated it. It's funny how things change when we become adults because this is one of the meals he asks me to make for him regularly.

#### Is Moong Dal Vegan? 

With one substitution, yes. Fry the onions in canola oil or vegetable oil instead of ghee. 

#### Can I freeze Moong Dal? 

Yes, allow the Moong Dal to cool and prepare several freezer-safe resealable plastic bags. Scoop a small amount of dal into each plastic bag, making sure to leave a few inches of space so the dish can expand if needed. Squeeze out as much air as you can before sealing the bag. Moong Dal will freeze for up to 2 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your side dishes.
