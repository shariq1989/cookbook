Servings: 6-8 <!--more-->

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 cup Yellow Lentils- Moong Dal, rinsed   
* 1 1/2 cup water 
* 1 tsp Kosher salt, to taste
* 2 tbsp turmeric, ground 
* 1 tbsp Kashmiri Chili Powder 
* 1/2 tsp Garam Masala
* 1 large Tomato, pureed in food processor 
* 1 tbsp Ginger, freshly grated 
* 2-3 Garlic Cloves, minced 
* Cilantro, chopped, for garnish 

For the Tadka: 
* 1 tbsp Ghee 
* 2 Green Chilis, split lengthwise 
* 2-3 Boriya Chilis, dried (Boriya Mirch) 
* 1 tsp Cumin Seeds 
* 1/2 tsp Mustard Seeds 
* 3-4 Curry Leaves (Curry Patta)  
* 1 large Red Onion, thinly sliced

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Set Instant Pot to saute mode and warm the ghee. 
2. Add the boriya chili, cumin seed, mustard seed, and curry leaves. 
3. Once the ingredients begin to sputter, add the onion and green chilis. Fry, stirring regularly until onions brown, not burned or charred. Reserve half of the onion mixture and set aside at room temperature. 
4. Add ginger, garlic, turmeric, chili powder, and garam masala to the pot, give it a quick stir and then add the tomatoes. Let mixture simmer, about 2 minutes. 
5. Combine rinsed moong dal, salt, and water with the other ingredients in the Instant Pot. Stir well, scraping up any leftover bits stuck to the bottom. 
6. Set the Instant Pot to high pressure and cook for 15-20 minutes. (This cooking time is for high elevation. Reduce cooking time for lower elevation). 
7. Allow the Instant Pot to naturally release for 5 minutes and then quick release. 
8. Stir the dal to check the consistency. If it is thicker then desired, add 1/2 cup HOT water before serving. 
9. Garnish dal with the reserved onion mixture, cilantro, and extra green chilis. 
10. Serve long-grained with Basmati rice.
