Servings: 6-8 <!--more-->

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 cup Yellow Lentils- Moong Dal, rinsed   
* 1 1/2 cup water 
* 1 tsp Kosher salt, to taste
* 2 tbsp turmeric, ground 
* 1 tbsp red chili powder (Not American red chili powder) 
* 1/2 tsp Garam Masala
* 1 large Tomato, chopped and pureed in food processor 
* 1 tbsp Ginger, freshly grated 
* 2-3 Garlic Cloves, minced 
* Cilantro, chopped, for garnish 

For the Tadka: 
* 1 tbsp Ghee 
* 2 Green Chilis, split 
* 2-3 Red Chilis, dried 
* 1 tsp Cumin Seeds 
* 1/2 tsp Mustard Seeds 
* 3-4 Curry Leaves 
* 1 Large Red Onion, thinly sliced

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Set Instant Pot to saute mode and warm the ghee. 
2. Toss in dried red chilis, cumin seed, mustard seed, and curry leaves. 
3. Once ingredients begin to sputter, add onion and green chilis. Fry, stirring regularly until onions brown, not burned or char. Reserve half of the onion mixture and set aside. 
4. Add ginger, garlic, turmeric, chili powder, and garam masala, give it a quick stir and add tomatoes. Let mixture simmer, about 2 minutes. 
5. Combine rinsed moong dal, salt, and water with the other ingredients in the Instant Pot. Stir, scraping up any leftover bits stuck to the bottom. 
6. Set the Instant Pot to high pressure and cook for 15-20 minutes. (This cooking time is for high elevation. You may reduce cooking time for lower elevation). 
7. Allow it the Instant Pot to naturally release for about 5 minutes and then release the rest of the pressure. 
8. Stir the dal to check the consistency. If it is too thick you can add 1/2 cup HOT water before serving. 
9. Serve the dal with the reserved onion mixture, cilantro, and extra green chilis for those who like more heat. 
10. Moong Dal is typically served with Basmati rice.
