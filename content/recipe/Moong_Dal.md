Servings: 6-8 <!--more-->

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 cup Yellow Lentils- Moong Dal, rinsed   
* 1 1/2 cup water 
* 1 tsp Kosher salt, to taste
* 2 tbsp turmeric, ground 
* 1 tbsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC) 
* 1/2 tsp [Garam Masala](https://amzn.to/3u0tvEX)
* 1 large Tomato, pureed in food processor 
* 1 tbsp Ginger, freshly grated 
* 2-3 Garlic Cloves, minced 
* Cilantro, chopped, for garnish 

For the Tadka: 

* 1 tbsp [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW) 
* 2 Thai Green Chilis, split lengthwise 
* 2-3 Boriya Chilis, dried 
* 1 tsp Cumin Seed
* 1/2 tsp Mustard Seed
* 3-4 Curry Leaves   
* 1 large Red Onion, thinly sliced

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Set an Instant Pot to saute mode and warm the ghee. 
2. Add the boriya chili, cumin seed, mustard seed, and curry leaves. 
3. Once the ingredients begin to sputter, add the onion and green chilis. Fry, stirring regularly, until the onions brown, not burned or charred. Reserve half of the onion mixture and set aside at room temperature. 
4. Add the ginger, garlic, turmeric, chili powder, and garam masala to the Instant Pot, give it a quick stir, and then add the tomatoes. Let the mixture simmer, about 2 minutes. 
5. Combine rinsed moong dal, salt, and water with the other ingredients in the Instant Pot. Stir well, scraping up any leftover bits stuck to the bottom. 
6. Secure the lid and set the Instant Pot to high pressure. Cook for 15-20 minutes. (This cooking time is for high elevation. Reduce cooking time for lower elevation). 
7. Allow the Instant Pot to naturally release for 5 minutes and then do a quick release. 
8. Stir the dal to check the consistency. If it is thicker than desired, add 1/2 cup HOT water before serving. 
9. Garnish with the reserved onion mixture, cilantro, and extra green chilis and serve long-grained with Basmati rice.
