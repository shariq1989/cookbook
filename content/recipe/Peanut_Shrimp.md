#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 ½ lbs extra-large Shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), peeled, deveined, and tails removed
* ½ teaspoon Kosher Salt, divided
* 1 tsp Black Peppercorns
* 2 tsp Coriander Seeds
* 1 tsp Paprika
* 2 Garlic Clove, minced
* 1 ⅛ tsp Sugar, divided
* ⅛ tsp Red Pepper Flakes
* 4 tsp Avocado Oil, divided
* ½ cup Cilantro Leaves and Stems, chopped
* 1 tbsp Lime Juice, plus lime wedges to garnish
* 3 tbsp Peanuts, coarsly chopped

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Toss the shrimp and 1/4 tsp of salt together in bowl and set aside for 15 minutes. 
2. Grind the black peppercorns and coriander seeds until coarsely ground. Transfer to small bowl and mix in the paprika, garlic, 1 teaspoon sugar, remaining ¼ teaspoon salt, and red pepper flakes. 
3. Pat the shrimp dry with a cloth to remove excess moisture. Add 1 tablespoon oil and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon sugar to bowl with shrimp and toss to coat. 
4. In a large skillet, add the shrimp in single layer and cook over high heat until undersides of shrimp are spotty brown and edges turn pink, about 3 minutes. 
5. Remove the pan from heat and use tongs to flip each shrimp and let stand until second side is opaque, about 2 minutes. Transfer shrimp to platter. 
6. Add the remaining teaspoon oil to the skillet. Add spice mixture, and cook over medium heat until fragrant, about 30 seconds. 
7. Return shrimp to skillet and add the cilantro and lime juice. Toss to combine. 
8. Transfer to platter, sprinkle with peanuts, and serve with lime wedges.
