### How to make Nutella and Peanut Butter Cookies

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 cup White Sugar
* 1 cup Brown Sugar
* 1 cup Soft Butter
* 2/3 cup Peanut Butter 
* 2 tsp Vanilla
* 2 Eggs
* 2 2/3 cups Flour, All-Purpose 
* 2 tsp Baking Soda
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 1/2 tsp Baking Powder
* 1/2 cup [Nutella](https://amzn.to/3vgU75p)

#### INSTRUCTIONS 

1. In a large bowl, mix the white and brown sugar. Then, use a [hand mixer](https://amzn.to/3bB2G3c) to blend the butter and peanut butter into the sugar until creamy.  
2. Stir in the vanilla and beat one egg at a time into the mixture. Set aside. 
3. In another bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder. Then, add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients. Blend until combined. 
4. Add 2-3 dollops of Nutella to the dough, fold it over gently, and then add 2-3 more dallops before folding it again. Then use a knife to swirl the Nutella into the dough. 
5. Cover the dough and place it in the fridge for 30 minutes. 
6. Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees. 
7. Drop spoonfuls of dough onto a lightly greased [baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3vhinF4) and bake for 15 minutes. This cooking time is for higher elevation. Reduce the cooking time to 10 minutes for lower elevation.

Finally, with a few adjustments for higher elevation (I didn't realize this was the issue for far too long) and the addition of peanut butter, this recipe was born.
