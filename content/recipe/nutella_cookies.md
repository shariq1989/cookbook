#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 cup White Sugar
* 1 cup Brown Sugar
* 1 cup Soft Butter
* 2/3 cup Peanut Butter 
* 2 tsp Vanilla

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a large bowl, mix the white and brown sugar, then use a hand mixer to blend in the butter and peanut butter until creamy.  
2. Stir in the vanilla and beat one egg at a time into the mixture.
3. In another bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder. Then add it to the wet ingredients. Blend until everything is combined. 
4. Add 2-3 dollops of Nutella to the dough, fold it over gently, and then add 2-3 more dallops before folding it again. Then use a knife to swirl the Nutella into the dough. You are not stirring it in. 
5. Cover the dough and place it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

#### ABOUT THIS DESSERT  

I've always loved cooking and baking, but I haven't always been great at it, especially baking. Back then, I wanted so badly to make something people actually wanted to eat, but no matter how much I tried, my attempts always failed. Then something incredible happened, Pinterest. While searching one day, I stumbled upon a Nutella cookie recipe; I was determined to master it. My poor mom and sisters ate cookies for a week straight as I experimented with their recipe to transform it into something tasty. Finally, with a few adjustments for high elevation (I didn't realize this was the issue for far too long) and the addition of peanut butter, this recipe was born. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* 2 large bowls 
* A [hand-mixer](https://amzn.to/3bB2G3c)
* A baking sheet 

#### Can I freeze the dough? 

Yes, roll the dough into one large ball and place it into a Ziploc bag. Clear any air out of the bag before securing it. The cookie dough will freeze for up to 3 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, follow the baking instructions for the recipe.
