### ABOUT THE DISH 

Saffron is a luxury spice commonly used in Persian, Indian, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern cuisine. While expensive, a little goes a long way. As a rule of thumb, I use ½ teaspoon of saffron for every 1 cup of rice. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Long Grained Basmati Rice: You can use other long-grained rice, but I recommend basmati. The key to a quality rice dish is taking the time to soak it; the longer, the better. By taking this step, your rice will have the length and luxury you want from good saffron rice. 
 
* Saffron Stems: Be sure to bloom the saffron before using it in this recipe. This process draws out the richness and fragrance of the saffron. Bloom by gently mixing the stems with a hot liquid, like water or milk.

* Butter: I prefer to use high-quality butter, like Kerrygold, since butter is central to the dish. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A medium-sized pot with a lid or an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/37WzcdO)

* A mortar and pestle or a bowl with a spoon 

* A small bowl 

#### Is saffron rice vegetarian? Is it vegan?

Saffron rice is easy to make and naturally vegetarian. To make this particular recipe vegan-friendly, mix the saffron with water and use vegan butter as a substitute. 

#### Can I freeze the saffron rice?

Yes, allow the dish to cool completely, and then add it to a gallon Ziploc bag. The saffron rice will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm up a single serving in the microwave or add it all to a pan for a quick and easy side the whole family will enjoy.
