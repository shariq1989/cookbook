Servings: 5 <!--more-->

Cooking Time: 30 minutes 

Cuisine: Persian 

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 2 cups Long-Grained Basmati Rice
* 2 cups Water 
* 1 tsp Kosher Salt 
* 2-3 [Green Cardamom Pods](https://amzn.to/3rVRDr7)
* 1 tsp Saffron Stems
* 2 tbsp Boiling Water or Milk
* 3 tbsp Butter 

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Rinse the rice until the water runs clear, then soak in water for 20 minutes. Drain and rinse once more. 
2. While waiting on the rice, add saffron to a mortar and pestle. You can also use a small bowl and the back of a spoon. Gently break down the stems into smaller pieces. Then, add boiling water or milk to the saffron (whichever you prefer). Stir and let it stand for 5 minutes. 
3. Add rice, water, salt, and cardamom pods to the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/37WzcdO). Secure the lid and cook on manual high pressure for 5 minutes.
4. Allow the Instant Pot to release naturally for 4 minutes before doing a quick release.
5. Open the lid and pour the saffron mixture over the rice in a circular motion. Secure the lid once more and cook on manual high pressure for another minute with a quick release. 
6. Layer the tabs of butter overtop the rice. Cover with the lid, but do not seal and let the rice stand until the butter infuses with the rice. 
7. Use a fork fluff the rice and serve.

#### ABOUT THE DISH 

Saffron is a luxury spice commonly used in Persian, Indian, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern cuisine. While expensive, a little goes a long way. As a rule of thumb, I use Â½ teaspoon of saffron for every 1 cup of rice. To draw out the richness and fragrance of the saffron, gently mix the stems with a hot liquid, like water, or milk.
