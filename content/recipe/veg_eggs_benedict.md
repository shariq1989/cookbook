Servings: 2-3 <!--more-->

Cuisine: American

#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Hollandaise Sauce: 

* 1 stick of Unsalted Butter
* 3 Egg Yolks
* 1 tbsp Lemon Juice
* 1/2 tsp Kosher Salt
* 1/4 tsp Cayenne Pepper
  
For the Poached Eggs: 

* 4 large Eggs
* 1 tbsp Distilled White Vinegar

For the Greens: 

* 1 tbsp Avocado Oil 
* 1 cup Spinach 
* 1 cup Arugula 
* 1/2 tsp Salt 
* 1/2 tsp Red Chili Flakes 
* 1/2 Avocado, sliced

#### INSTRUSTIONS

For the Hollandaise Sauce:

1. In a microwave-safe dish, microwave the butter. 
2. Once hot, slowly whisk the egg yolks into the butter until emulsified. 
3. Next, mix the lemon juice, salt, and cayenne powder. 
4. Set aside. 

For the Poached Eggs: 

1. Crack an egg into a small sieve over the bowl with the egg whites from the hollandaise sauce. Do this to remove the excess egg white. Then, place the egg in a ramekin. Repeat with the rest of the eggs. 
2. Bring a pot of water (at least 4 inches of water) to a boil (WHILE BOILING, SKIP TO THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR GREENS). 
3. Stir the vinegar into the water and swirl the pot. While the water is moving, add the eggs and cook for 3 minutes.
4. While the eggs are cooking, set a trivet over the boiling water and place the reserved hollandaise mixture onto the trivet. Continue whisking while eggs cook, and the hollandaise sauce warms.  

For the  Greens: 

1. While the water for the eggs is coming to a boil, warm oil in a small saute pan. 
2. Add the spinach and arugula. Cook until wilted. 
3. Stir in the salt and red chili flakes until combined. 
4. Plate the greens and top with sliced avocado. 

To Serve: 

1. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and set them onto the greens.
2. Top with hollandaise sauce, and enjoy right away!
