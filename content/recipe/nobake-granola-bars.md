### How to Make No-Bake Paleo Granola Bars 

#### Ingredients  

 * 1 cup Cashews 
 * 1 cup Almonds 
 * 2 tbsp [Chia Seeds](https://amzn.to/3lF0axu) 
 * 2 tbsp [Flax Seeds](https://amzn.to/3oqW0uY)
 * 1 cup [Coconut Flakes](https://amzn.to/3IneYdP) 
 * 1 cup Craisins
 * 1 tsp Cinnamon 
 * 1/4 cup Coconut Oil 
 * 1/4 cup Honey 
 * 1/4 cup [Almond Butter](https://amzn.to/3ljxdqJ) 
 * 1 tsp [Vanilla Extract](https://amzn.to/3xPaWpX) 

#### Instructions

1. Place the cashews and almonds in a [food processor](https://amzn.to/32jLA7Q) and pulse a few times to break them up. You don't want to over-mix and create a flour-like texture.
2. Fill a small bowl with warm water and add the craisins. Let them sit for about 5 minutes until they soften and rehydrate. 
3. Move the mixture from the [food processor](https://amzn.to/32jLA7Q) to a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3CFijkm) and stir in chia seeds, flax seeds, coconut flakes, soaked craisins, and ground cinnamon until combined. Set aside. 
4. In a [saute pan](https://amzn.to/3nC6gjK), warm coconut oil and then whisk in the honey and almond butter until smooth. Off heat, stir in the vanilla extract. 
5. Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients and combine the two using a [silicone spatula](https://amzn.to/3ctiG77). Then gently fold in the chocolate chips. 
6. Line a [baking pan](https://amzn.to/3FA9RVk) with parchment paper. It's helpful if the parchment paper comes up and over the sides for easy removal later on.
7. Transfer the mixture to the pan and pack it down using a spatula or another piece of parchment paper. You want it packed tight so that the bars have a better chance of staying together once you have sliced them. 
8. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and set it in the freezer for 1 hour.
9. Remove the pan from the freezer and grab opposing ends of the parchment paper to remove the bars. Transfer them to a cutting board.
10. Use a sharp knife to cut the mixture into bars. You can do squares or rods, whichever you prefer.

### About the Granola Bars 

Our no-bake paleo granola bars are chewy, crunchy, sweet, and salty. They are easy to make, and you can make extra to prep for the rest of the week. They are the perfect addition to any paleo, grain-free, or gluten-free way of eating. These granola bars are a favorite in our home, and kid-approved.

#### What ingredients are needed?

* Cashews and Almonds: We always have almonds and cashews in our pantry. If I weren't allergic, walnuts or pecans would be a tasty addition to these bars.   

* [Chia Seeds](https://amzn.to/3lF0axu) and [Flax Seeds](https://amzn.to/3oqW0uY): Chia and flaxseeds add texture and healthy fat to the granola bars. 

* [Coconut Flakes](https://amzn.to/3IneYdP): I prefer unsweetened coconut flakes. 

* Craisins

* Cinnamon 

* Coconut Oil 

* Honey

* [Almond Butter](https://amzn.to/3ljxdqJ)

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [food processor](https://amzn.to/32jLA7Q) 
* A small bowl
* A [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3CFijkm)

#### How should I store the granola bars?

Since coconut oil is a main ingredient, the bars will melt if left at room temperature. To store, keep them chilled in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.
