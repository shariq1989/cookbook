### About the Cookies

I’ve always loved cooking and baking, but I haven’t always been great at it- especially baking. With the success of my [nutella cookies]({{< ref "he-nutella-cookies" >}}), I was on a mission to bake the perfect chocolate chip cookie. Well, here it is, folks. I hope you enjoy these chocolate chip cookies our family loves, with specific instructions for high elevation.  

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

Butter: I use two sticks of butter in this recipe, and what I am about to tell you is the key for high-elevation cookies that do not cave in. Before you begin, allow the butter to reach room temperature. Do not, I repeat, do not melt the butter. 

* White Sugar 

* Brown Sugar 

* Eggs 

* [Vanilla Extract](https://amzn.to/3xw7Si9)

* All-Purpose Flour 

* Baking Soda: Baking soda is a necessary ingredient for many chocolate chip cookie recipes, but in this one, we have you dissolve it in hot water. Why? I use the hot water to ensure the baking soda fully dissolves; this extra step ensures a more even distribution of the baking soda throughout the mixture.

* Salt 

* Unsweetened Chocolate Chips

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3D2NC8M)
* A [hand-mixer](https://amzn.to/3rRtUs2)
* A [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3vhinF4) or a pizza stone- I use the one from Pampered Chef.

#### Can I freeze the cookie dough?

You sure can. Roll the dough into one large ball and place it into a freezer-safe bag. Clear any air out of the bag before securing it. The cookie dough will keep for three months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, follow the baking instructions in this recipe.
