FRENCH ONION SOUP

Servings: 4 <!--more-->

Time: 2 hours 

Cuisine: French 

Adapted from: Serious Eats, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 4 tbsp Unsalted Butter, plus more to butter the baguette slices
* 4 small Baguette slices
* 3 lb Sweet Onion, very thinly sliced, about 5-6 large onions
* ½ tsp Baking Powder 
* Kosher Salt and Coarse Ground Pepper, to taste  
* ½ cup Dry Sherry 
* 2 qt Water and 2 tbsp Beef, Better Than Bouillion 
* 2 Thyme Sprigs 
* 1 Bay Leaf 
* 1 tsp [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/3jMYZdj) 
* 1 medium Garlic Clove, punctured
* 1 lb [Gruyere Cheese](https://amzn.to/3aZfe2E), grated 

#### INSTRUCTIONS 

For the Soup:  

1. Melt the butter in an Instant Pot on saute mode. Add the onions and baking powder, stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until onions soften and begin to release liquid, about 3 minutes. 
2. Seal the Instant Pot lid and cook on high pressure for 20 minutes with a quick release. 
3. Continue cooking with the lid off, stirring constantly, until the liquid inside is reduced and the onions become brown and sticky, about 5 minutes.
4. Add the sherry and bring the mixture to a simmer, scraping up any brown bits left behind by the onion. Cook until the alcohol smell is mostly gone, about 3 minutes.
5. Next, add the water and Better Than Bouillion, thyme sprigs, and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer for 10 minutes.
6. Stir in the fish sauce and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf before serving.

To Serve: 

1. Move the oven rack to the top position and preheat the broiler to high.  
2. Butter the baguette slices and rub them with the garlic clove until fragrant. 
3. Spoon broth into the bottom of 4 oven-safe bowls, sprinkle with Gruyère, and then top with the baguette slices. Spoon a bit more broth overtop. 
4. Cover with the remaining Gruyère and set bowls onto a rimmed baking sheet. 
5. Broil the soup until the cheese is melted and brown spots begin to appear, if you can wait that long.  

#### ABOUT THE MEAL

French Onion Soup is a timeless classic and also happens to be one of my go-to comfort foods. It's a perfect meal for those cold and snowy days, which are common here in Colorado during the winter. You can use any onions for this soup, but I recommend using sweet onions because of the flavor they release and the ease with which they caramelize. 

By the way, did I tell you about that one time I saved a little girl's life from a flying bowl of steaming hot french onion soup? I may have received some second-degree burns to my forearm by jumping in front of her, but I sure felt like a superhero that day. I think about this moment every time I eat french onion soup.
