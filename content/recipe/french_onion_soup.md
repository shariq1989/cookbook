#### INGREDIENTS 

* 4 tbsp [Unsalted Butter](https://amzn.to/2NK7WbO), plus more for the baguette slices
* 4 small Baguette slices
* 3 lb Vadalia Onion, thinly sliced, about 5-6 large onions
* ½ tsp Baking Powder 
* Kosher Salt and Coarse Ground Pepper, to taste  
* ½ cup Dry Sherry 
* 2 qt Water and 2 tbsp [Beef Better Than Bouillion](https://amzn.to/2Pk82Hf)
* 2 Thyme Sprigs 
* 1 Bay Leaf 
* 1 tsp [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/3jMYZdj) 
* 1 medium Garlic Clove, punctured, for the toast
* 1 lb [Gruyere Cheese](https://amzn.to/3aZfe2E), grated 

#### INSTANT POT INSTRUCTIONS 

For the Soup:  

1. Melt the butter in an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) on saute mode. Add the onions and baking powder, stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until onions soften and begin to release liquid, about 3 minutes. 
2. Seal the Instant Pot lid and cook on manual high pressure for 20 minutes with a quick release. 
3. Continue cooking the onions with the lid off until the liquid inside reduces and the onions become brown and sticky, about 5 minutes. Be sure to stir constantly to prevent burning. 
4. Add the sherry and bring the mixture to a simmer, scraping up any brown bits left behind. Cook until the alcohol smell is mostly gone.
5. Next, add the water, Better Than Bouillion, thyme sprigs, and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer for 10 minutes.
6. Stir in the fish sauce and season with salt and pepper. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf before serving.

To Serve: 

1. Move the oven rack to the top position and preheat the broiler on high.  
2. Butter the baguette slices and rub them with a punctured garlic clove. 
3. Spoon broth into the bottom of 4 oven-safe bowls, sprinkle with the shredded Gruyère, and then top it with the baguette slices.  
4. Spoon a bit more broth over the top and cover with the remaining Gruyère. 
5. Set the bowls onto a rimmed baking sheet. Place the baking sheet into the oven.
6. Broil until the cheese melts and brown spots begin to appear if you can wait that long.

#### ABOUT THE MEAL

French onion soup is a timeless classic and happens to be on the list of my favorite comfort foods. It is the perfect meal for those chilly days that make you want to curl up with a warm bowl of soup. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal? 

* Onions: You can use any onion, but I recommend using Vidalia. I prefer their sweetness and the ease with which they caramelize. French onion soup is made with thinly sliced yellow onions. 

* Butter: Butter is the tastiest and most French approach to caramelize the onions. Because this is the most critical step to develop the flavor of French onion soup, I encourage you to splurge for higher quality butter, like [Kerrygold](https://amzn.to/3c5Q433). 

* Bread: You can use any bread, but I recommended slicing up a delicious baguette, buttering that thing up, rubbing it with a garlic clove, and using that to top your soup. 

* Cheese: The classic choice is Gruyere, and I do not deviate from that. It is the more expensive alternative, but so worth it when making this soup. However, if you're looking for a budget-friendly cheese, you can substitute it with swiss, asiago, or parmesan.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe? 

* An Instant Pot
* 4 Oven-safe bowls 
* A rimmed baking sheet.
* A cheese grater

#### Is French onion soup vegetarian? Is it vegan? 

Cooked traditionally, no. However, with these easy substitutions, you will still get the classic french onion soup taste. 

* Butter: Use olive oil or vegan butter to caramelize the onions. 

* Beef Broth: Replace with a vegetarian broth. I recommend using a mushroom-based broth to highlight the other flavors in the soup. 

* Fish Sauce: Use either Worcestershire sauce or marmite. 

* Cheese: If making vegan, reach for vegan cheese instead. 

#### Can I freeze French onion soup? 

Yes, first allow the dish to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container. French onion soup can freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm the soup on a stove-top and then skip to the "to serve" instructions in this recipe. Enjoy.
