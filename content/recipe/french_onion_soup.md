#### INGREDIENTS 

* 4 tbsp [Unsalted Butter](https://amzn.to/2NK7WbO), plus more for the baguette slices
* 4 small Baguette slices
* 3 lb Vadalia Onion, thinly sliced, about 5-6 large onions
* ½ tsp Baking Powder 
* Kosher Salt and Coarse Ground Pepper, to taste  
* ½ cup Dry Sherry 
* 2 qt Water and 2 tbsp [Beef Better Than Bouillion](https://amzn.to/2Pk82Hf)
* 2 Thyme Sprigs 
* 1 Bay Leaf 
* 1 tsp [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/3jMYZdj) 
* 1 medium Garlic Clove, punctured, for the toast
* 1 lb [Gruyere Cheese](https://amzn.to/3aZfe2E), grated 

#### INSTRUCTIONS 

For the Soup:  

1. Melt the butter in an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) on saute mode. Add the onions and baking powder, stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until onions soften and release liquid, about 3 minutes. 
2. Seal the Instant Pot lid and cook on manual high pressure for 20 minutes with a quick release. 
3. Continue cooking with the lid off, stirring constantly, until the liquid inside reduces and the onions become brown and sticky about 5 minutes.
4. Add the sherry and bring the mixture to a simmer, scraping up any brown bits left behind by the onion. Cook until the alcohol smell is mostly gone, about 3 minutes.
5. Next, add the water, Better Than Bouillion, thyme sprigs, and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer for 10 minutes.
6. Stir in the fish sauce and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf before serving.

To Serve: 

1. Move the oven rack to the top position and preheat the broiler on high.  
2. Butter the baguette slices and rub them with the punctured garlic clove. 
3. Spoon broth into the bottom of 4 oven-safe bowls, sprinkle with Gruyère, and then top with the baguette slices. Spoon a bit more broth overtop. 
4. Cover with the remaining Gruyère and set bowls onto a rimmed baking sheet. Place the sheet into the oven.
5. Broil until the cheese is melted and brown spots begin to appear if you can wait that long. I usually cannot.   

#### ABOUT THE MEAL

French onion soup is a timeless classic and also happens to be on my list of my favorite comfort foods. It's the perfect meal for those chilly days that make you want to curl up with a warm bowl of soup. 

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal? 

* Onions: You can use any onion for this soup, but I highly recommend using the Vidalia variety. I prefer the sweetness they release and the ease with which they caramelize. Classically, French onion soup is made with thinly sliced yellow onions. 

* Butter: This is the tastiest and most French way to carmelize your onions. Because caramelization is the most important step in building the flavor of French onion soup, I encourage you to splurge for higher quality butter, like [Kerrygold](https://amzn.to/3c5Q433). You won't regret it. 

* Bread: Again, you can use any bread, but I recommended slicing up a delicious baguette, buttering that thing up, rubbing it with a garlic clove, and using that to top your soup. 

* Cheese: The classic choice is Gruyere and I personally do not deviate from that. It is the more expensive alternative, but so worth it when making this soup. However, if you're looking for a more budget-friendly cheese, you can substitute it with swiss, asiago, or parmesan.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe? 

You will need an Instant Pot, though you could easily make it on the stovetop with longer cook-times. You will also need 4 oven-safe bowls and a rimmed baking sheet to set them on. 

#### Is French onion soup vegetarian? Is French onion soup vegan? 

Made traditionally, no. However, you can make these easy substitutions that won't take away from the classic flavor of the soup: 

* Butter: Use olive oil or vegan butter to caramelize the onions. 

* Beef Broth: Substitute with a vegetarian broth. I highly recommend using a mushroom-based broth or the vegetable flavored Better than Bouillion. 

* Fish Sauce: You can use either Worcestershire sauce or marmite. 

* Cheese: If making vegan, reach for a block of vegan cheese and use that instead. 

#### Can I freeze French onion soup? 

Yes, you sure can. First, let the soup completely cool, then add it to a freezer-safe container. It's as easy as that and it can freeze for up to 3 months. When you're ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm the soup on a stovetop and skip to the, to serve, part of our instructions.
