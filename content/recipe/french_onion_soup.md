Servings: 4<!--more-->

Adapted from: Serious Eats, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 4 tbsp Unsalted Butter, plus more to butter toast 
* 4 small Baguette Slices
* 3 lb Sweet Onion, very thinly sliced, about 5-6 large onions
* ½ tsp Baking Powder 
* Kosher Salt and Coarse Ground Pepper, to taste  
* ½ cup Dry Sherry 
* 2 qt Water and 2 tbsp Beef Better Than Bouillion or [Chicken Stock](https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/10/how-to-make-rich-flavorful-easy-chicken-stock.html)
* 2 Thyme Sprigs 
* 1 Bay Leaf 
* 1 tsp [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/3jMYZdj) 
* 1 tsp Apple Cider Vinegar
* 1 medium Garlic Clove 
* 1 lb [Gruyere Cheese](https://amzn.to/3aZfe2E), grated 

#### INSTRUCTIONS 

For the Soup:  

1. Melt butter in an Instant Pot on saute mode. Add onions and baking powder, stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until onions slightly soften and start to release liquid, about 3 minutes. 
2. Seal the Instant Pot lid and cook on high pressure for 20 minutes with a quick release. 
3. Continue cooking with the lid off, stirring constantly, until the liquid inside is reduced and the onions are brown and sticky, about 5 minutes.
4. Add the sherry and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits left behind by the onion. Cook until the alcohol smell is mostly gone, about 3 minutes.
5. Next, add the stock, thyme sprigs, and a bay leaf, and bring to a simmer, for 10 minutes.
6. Stir in the fish sauce and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf before serving.

To Serve: 

1. Move oven rack to the top position and preheat the broiler to high.  
2. Butter toasts and rub with a punctured garlic clove until fragrant. 
3. Spoon broth into the bottom of oven-safe bowls, sprinkle with Gruyère, and then top the soup with the baguette slices. 
4. Cover the toast with the remaining grated cheese and set bowls onto a rimmed baking sheet. 
5. Broil the soup until the cheese is melted and brown spots begin to appear, if you can wait. 
6. Allow soup to cool before serving. 


#### THE STORY BEHIND THE MEAL 

French Onion Soup is a timeless classic and also happens to be one of my most favorite comfort foods of all time. It is the perfect meal for those cold and snowy days, which are common during our Colorado winters.
