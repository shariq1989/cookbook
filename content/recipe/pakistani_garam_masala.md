### ABOUT GARAM MASALA
Garam Masala, in English, means "hot spice." It is the main ingredient in many Indian dishes. Garam Masala doesn't carry the name "hot spice" because it is spicy, but more so because of the warming spices used and the process of toasting the spices before grinding them. 

While you can buy garam masala in stores, in most Bengali, Indian, and Pakistani homes, you will find a family-treasured garam masala recipe. While the exact spices and their measurements differ from home to home, the process for making garam masala is always the same. Begin by measuring the fresh, whole spices, toast them in a pan, grind them finely, and preserved them for many meals to come in an air-tight container. Garam masala is an essential ingredient for most Indian recipes and easily alters the taste of what you're making. Finding the right combination is crucial; here is one of the authentic garam masala recipes we use in our home most often.

#### Garam Masala list of ingredients:

* For this recipe, I use green cardamom pods, black cardamom pods, a cinnamon stick, cloves, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, nutmeg, mace, and bay leaves.
