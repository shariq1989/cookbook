Preparation Time: 20 minutes 

Cook Time: 40 minutes 

Cuisine: Indian

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 stick Butter, divided 
* 5 [Green Cardamom Pods](https://amzn.to/3tZaNOd), lightly crushed
* 1 Cinnamon Stick
* 4 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 1 tbsp Ginger, minced
* 2 Green Chilis, slit lengthwise, plus more to garnish
* 1 tsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC) 
* 1 1/2 tsp Garam Masala
* 1 tsp Cumin 
* 1 tsp Salt
* 3 medium Tomatoes, chopped 
* 1/2 cup Heavy Cream
* 3-5 Chicken Thighs, skinless, bone-in
* Cilantro, chopped, to garnish

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a heavy-bottomed pan, warm 1 1/2 tbsp of butter. Add the green cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, and garlic. Cook until the ingredients begin to sputter.
2. Add the ginger and green chilies and fry the mixture for 1 minute.
3. Stir the Kashmiri chili powder, garam masala, cumin, salt, and tomatoes into the mixture and simmer for about 2 minutes. 
4. Remove the cinnamon stick and pour the mixture into a food processor. Collect the reserved butter, cut it into cubes and add them to the food processor as well. Blend until smooth. You could also use an immersion blender for this step.  
5. Return the mixture to the pan. Lower the heat and nestle the chicken thighs into the pan. Allow the dish to maintain a gentle bubble, stirring occasionally, for 25-30 minutes.
6. Remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool for a few minutes before adding the heavy cream- this helps maintain the dish's creaminess. Stir in the cream until it is thoroughly combined. 
7. Garnish with cilantro and green chilis and serve with basmati rice or naan.

#### ABOUT THE MEAL

Butter chicken originated in Dehli, India, and later spread throughout the western world. It's no wonder why since this butter chicken recipe offers a great introduction to the flavor and spices of Indian cooking. For that reason, this one of the dishes we reach for most often when entertaining guests over who have never tasted Indian food before. It also happens to be my most requested recipe from friends and family. 

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Chicken: We use bone-in chicken thighs, however, you can substitute boneless chicken thighs or chicken breasts if you prefer. If using chicken breasts, follow the suggested cooking time for this recipe, but be sure to cut the chicken into 1-inch pieces. If using boneless chicken thighs, reduce the cooking time to 20 minutes to prevent overcooked, rubbery chicken. 
-- The safe cooking temperature for chicken is 160 degrees. 

* Butter: We use high-quality butter, like Kerrygold, since it is central to the flavor of the dish. 

* Cream: I prefer using heavy cream in my butter chicken because it's creamy and delicious, but also because it blends without being temperamental. 

* Garam Masala: India is a vast country, with varying sub-cultures, so Indian food differs from region to region as a result; this applies to spices as well. For example, garam masala is a necessary ingredient for butter chicken, but the flavor changes drastically depending on what garam masals you use. For this reason, I suggest making garam masala at home so you can control the amount of each spice used in the mix and cater it specifically to your preferences. If you choose to go the store-bought route, I suggest [Rani](https://amzn.to/3eqFSFa), Spice House, or Penzey's garam masala. 

* Tomatoes: I use fresh ingredients whenever possible, but you can also use canned diced tomatoes. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A heavy-bottomed pan with a lid
* A food processor or immersion blender 

#### Can butter chicken be made vegetarian? Can butter chicken be made vegan? Can I make butter chicken dairy-free? 

With substitutions, this recipe caters well to both a vegetarian and vegan diet. 

* Vegetarian: Let's begin by finding a replacement for the chicken, shall we? I recommend using chickpeas, firm tofu, paneer, or roasted cauliflower. These ingredients take on the flavor of the dish and hold up well during the cooking process. 

* Vegan: I prefer using chickpeas, firm tofu, or roasted cauliflower in place of the meat in this dish. They are delicious and hold up well during the cooking process. You can also include toasted cashews for tasty addition and added protein. Instead of butter, I recommend either coconut oil or vegan butter, and you can use full-fat coconut milk as an alternative to the cream.

* Dairy-Free: In place of butter and cream, use coconut oil and coconut milk. 

#### Is butter chicken keto or low-carb?
It is. We even calculated the macros for one chicken thigh and some of the sauce to make it easier for you.  

CARBS– 5 Net Carbs
PROTEIN– 26g
FAT–41g

We suggest serving this butter chicken with a side of cauliflower rice or keto naan. 

#### Can I freeze butter chicken?

Yes, first allow the dish to cool completely and add it to a freezer-safe container. It will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it on the stovetop and prepare your sides.
