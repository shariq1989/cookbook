1. Place eggs in a single layer on the [trivet](https://amzn.to/38G3NNi) in an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) and add 1 cup of water. Secure the lid and set it to manual high pressure for 5 minutes. Allow for natural release for 5 minutes, followed by an ice bath for another 5 minutes.  
2. Crack egg shells and carefully peel under cool running water. Gently dry with paper towels. 
3. Slice the eggs in half lengthwise, removing yolks into a bowl; place the whites on a serving platter. 
4. Mash the yolks into a fine crumble using a fork. Add mayonnaise, mustard, paprika, dill, and salt. Mix well. 
5. Evenly disperse the yolk mixture into the egg whites. 
6. Sprinkle lightly with paprika to serve.
