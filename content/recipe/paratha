Cuisine: Indian, Pakistani 

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 3 cups All-Purpose Flour 
* 1 tsp Salt 
* 1 Egg
* 3 tbsp Ghee, plus more for rolling and frying 
* 1 cup Water, added little by little 

#### STOVE-TOP DIRECTIONS 

For the Dough: 

1. In a large bowl, mix the flour, salt, egg and oil. Slowly add water, a little bit at a time. Mixing with your hands until a soft dough forms. 
2. Knead the dough for 4 to 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and roll it into a ball. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and set it aside for 20 minutes.
3. Divide the dough into ten pieces. On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece into a circle.

Take 2 cups of whole wheat flour.
Sieve the wheat flour before using.
Collect the sieved flour in the bowl.
Add some 2 tsp. ghee in the flour.
You can also add 1.5 tsp. oil if not ghee.
Now, add some salt in the flour. (I added Â½ tsp. salt. You can add as per your taste.)
Add some water in the flour for kneading.
Start kneading and make a soft dough.
If paratha dough is not soft or smooth, add more water.
If paratha dough is too soft, add more flour in it.
You must add water at regular intervals while kneading.
Knead the paratha dough nicely.
Loosely cover the bowl with the plate.
You may also wrap the dough with a moist cloth.
Keep the dough bowl aside for 30 minutes.

Rolling the Parathas: Circular Method 

Break off various pieces from dough log.
Creating equal sized pieces of the dough.
Take a small bit of the dough or this one piece.
Pinch small or medium piece from dough.
Now, after you take a tiny ball, keep on your palm.
Now, roll it between your palms.
Roll in way of forming a ball
You should make a round shaped ball of it.
After making a ball of dough, gently press it between your palms.
Flatten the round ball of the dough.
You must press in a way like creating a disc shape.
Take rolling board and pin set.
Apply some flour and place it at centre of the rolling board.
Dust only little amount of wheat flour. Just enough to roll.
You can also dip both sides of flattened dough in the flour.
With the help of rolling pin, roll the flattened dough ball.
Make a circle of around 3.5 to 4-inch diameter.
It should not be too thin or too thick.
Spread oil over the surface of rolled dough.
Sprinkle flour over the oiled surface.
Fold the flattened dough.
Then again roll into a disc
Dip the disc back into the rice flour.
Roll out into a 6 inch round paratha.


Cooking the Parathas: 
1. Warm a griddle over medium-high heat. Once the griddle is hot, carefully place the rolled out paratha on the surface and cook until the bottom of the paratha turns lighter than the uncooked top, about 1 minute.
2. With a flat spatula, flip the paratha and top with ghee, spreading it evenly over the surface with the back of the spoon. Cook the second side until it turns light brown, about 2 minutes.
3. Flip the paratha and top with ghee, spreading it evenly over the surface. Cook until light brown, 1 to 2 minutes.
4. Gently press the paratha with the spatula to help the paratha cook evenly; be sure to press gently for a soft, flaky paratha. Once both sides get spotty golden brown, transfer the paratha to a plate.
Repeat with the remaining dough pieces, oil, and ghee. While one paratha is cooking you can start to roll the next. Enjoy warm!

### ABOUT THE MEAL

Parathas are a staple in Indian homes and for good reason; they are tasty. Parathas are an unleavened bread made by layering and rolling dough that is later cooked until it becomes golden brown. Parathas are eaten for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. In our home, they are a regular part of our breakfast rotation enjoyed with eggs and achar (or pickled mangos).
