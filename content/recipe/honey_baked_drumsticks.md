Preparation Time: 10 minutes

Cooking Time: 40 minutes

Marinating Time: 1 hour - 8 hours 

Cuisine: American 

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 2 tsp Miso Paste
* 2 tbsp Water 
* 3 tbsp Olive Oil 
* 1/2 cup Honey
* 1 tsp Apple Cider Vinegar
* 1 tbsp Smoked Paprika
* 1 tsp Garlic Powder
* 1 tsp Cayenne Powder 
* 2 tsp Salt 
* 10 Chicken Drumsticks, bone-in, skin on

#### INSTRUSTIONS

1. Warm 2 tbsp of water in a small bowl and stir in the miso paste until it dissolves. 
2. Add the miso mixture to a Ziploc bag, along with the rest of the ingredients. Squeeze the bag to combine the ingredients. 
3. Add the drumsticks and massage the marinade into the chicken. 
4. Place the bag in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. For best result, marinate for at least 8 hours. 
5. Prepare a rimmed baking sheet with a wire rack and preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 
6. Arrange the drumsticks onto the wire rack. Bake for 20 minutes, and then flip the drumsticks halfway. Bake for another 20 minutes. 
7. If you prefer crip skin the way we do, broil the chicken on high for 2-3 minutes.
8. Allow the chicken to rest and serve it with a fresh salad, your favorite vegetable, rice, or try another sheet pan side like Ras El Hanout butternut squash and cook them both at the same time.

### ABOUT THE MEAL

Who doesn't love a crispy baked chicken drumstick? The glaze is sweet, smoky, and savory, and you will love the umami created by the miso paste. This recipe is oven-baked, and all you need is one sheet pan and less than an hour to make it.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken Drumsticks: We used drumsticks for this recipe, but this recipe is just as tasty with bone-in chicken thighs. If you use chicken thighs, I suggest increasing the cooking time slightly. The safe temperature for chicken is 165 degrees. 

* Honey: Honey sweetens the chicken and creates a beautiful caramelization for the chicken. 

* Miso Paste: For this recipe, I suggest using white miso paste. If you don't have miso paste on hand, you can use soy sauce.  

* Spices: I flavor the chicken using a combination of smoked paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and salt. If cayenne is too spicy, you can use coarse ground pepper instead.
