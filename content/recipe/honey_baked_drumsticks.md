Servings: 10 drumsticks  <!--more-->

Preparation Time: 10 minutes

Cooking Time: 40 minutes

Marinating Time: 1 - 8 hours 

Cuisine: American 

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 2 tsp White Miso Paste
* 2 tbsp Water 
* 3 tbsp Olive Oil
* 1/3 cup Honey
* 1 tsp Apple Cider Vinegar
* 1 tbsp Smoked Paprika
* 1 tsp Garlic Powder
* 1 tsp Cayenne Powder 
* 2 tsp Salt 
* 10 Chicken Drumsticks, bone-in, skin on

#### INSTRUSTIONS

1. Warm 2 tbsp of water in a small bowl and stir the miso paste and 1 tsp of olive oil until the miso dissolves completely. 
2. Add the miso mixture to a Ziploc bag, along with the rest of the ingredients. Seal the bag and combine the ingredients. 
3. Add the drumsticks and seal the bag once again. Then, massage the marinade into the chicken. 
4. Place the bag in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. For best result, marinate for at least 8 hours. 
5. Prepare a rimmed baking sheet with a wire rack and preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 
6. Arrange the drumsticks onto the wire rack and bake for 20 minutes. Flip the drumsticks halfway and bake for another 20 minutes. 
7. If you prefer crispier skin the way we do, you can broil the chicken on high for 2-3 minutes. 
8. Allow the chicken to rest for about 5 minutes. Serve the drumsticks with a fresh salad, vegetables, rice, or try another sheet pan side like Ras El Hanout-spiced butternut squash and cook them simultaneously.

### ABOUT THE MEAL

Who doesn't love a crispy baked chicken drumstick? The glaze is sweet, smoky, and savory, and you will love the umami created by the miso paste. This recipe is oven-baked, and all you need is one sheet pan and less than an hour to make it.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken Drumsticks: We suggest drumsticks, but this recipe is just as tasty with bone-in chicken thighs as well. If using chicken thighs, increase the cooking time some. The safe internal temperature for chicken is 165 degrees. 

* Honey: Honey sweetens the chicken and creates a beautiful caramelization on the chicken skin for you to enjoy. 

* Miso Paste: For this recipe, I suggest using white miso paste. If you don't have miso paste on hand, you can use soy sauce.  

* Spices: I flavor the chicken using a combination of smoked paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and salt. If cayenne is too spicy, you can use coarse ground pepper instead.
