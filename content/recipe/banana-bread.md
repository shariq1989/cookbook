### About the Bread 

A moist and delicious baked banana bread recipe that our family loves, especially the kids. It is easy to make, and there is no need for a mixer!

#### What main ingredients are needed for this bread?

* All-Purpose Flour

* Sugar: I use a mix of brown and white sugar. 

* Baking Soda 

* Baking Powder 

* Cinnamon: Cinnamon is optional, but it balances the flavors well and adds a rich brown coloring to the bread that makes it feel warm and cozy. 

* Unsalted Butter: Other banana bread recipes use oil, but I enjoy the flavor and texture butter lends to the bread. 

* Bananas: Use bananas that have begun to freckle and are a little too soft to snack on. The riper the banana, the richer the flavor will become. 

* Eggs & Milk: I use eggs and milk to bind everything together.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* 2 [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3rczKGV)

#### How should I store banana bread? 

To keep your banana bread moist, allow it to cool completely and then wrap it in a layer of plastic. Next, store it in a Ziploc bag or a container with a tight-fitting lid. It will last on the counter for up to 3 days. 

#### Can I freeze banana bread?

You sure can. First, allow the banana bread to cool completely and then wrap it in plastic wrap, followed by foil. The banana bread will freeze for up to 2 months. When you're ready to eat, let it defrost at room temperature, and enjoy!
