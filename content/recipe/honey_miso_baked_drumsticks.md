### How to Make Honey and Miso Baked Chicken Drumsticks

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 2 tbsp Water 
* 3 tbsp White Miso Paste
* 1 tsp Olive Oil
* 1/4 cup Honey
* 1 tsp Apple Cider Vinegar
* 2 tbsp Smoked Paprika
* 1 tbsp Garlic Powder
* 1 tbsp Cayenne Powder 
* 1 tbsp Kosher Salt 
* 10 Chicken Drumsticks, bone-in, skin on

#### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Warm 2 tbsp of water in a small bowl and then stir in the miso paste and olive oil until the miso dissolves completely.
2. Add the miso mixture to a [bag](https://amzn.to/3ldgNQH), along with the honey, vinegar, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and salt. Seal the bag and combine the ingredients. 
3. Add the drumsticks and seal the bag once again. Then, massage the marinade into the chicken. 
4. Place the bag in the fridge for at least 1 hour. For the best result, marinate for at least 6 hours. 
5. Set a [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3w2Mkrm) into a [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3uIJ2sZ), and preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 
6. Arrange the drumsticks onto the [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3w2Mkrm) and bake for 20 minutes. Flip the drumsticks halfway and bake for another 20 minutes. 
7. If you prefer crispier skin the way we do, you can broil the chicken on high for 2-3 minutes. 
8. Allow the chicken to rest for 3-5 minutes. Serve these drumsticks with a fresh salad, vegetables, rice, or try another sheet pan side like our [Moroccan-spiced butternut squash].

### ABOUT THE MEAL

Who doesn't love a crispy chicken drumstick? The glaze is sweet, smoky, and savory, and you will love the umami created by the miso. This recipe is oven-baked, and all you need is one sheet pan and less than an hour to make it. I hope you enjoy this honey and miso baked chicken drumstick recipe our family loves. 

#### What ingredients do I need for this meal?

* White Miso Paste: I love the flavor created by the white miso paste. 

* Olive Oil 

* Honey: Honey sweetens the chicken and creates a beautiful caramelization on the skin for you to enjoy. 

* Apple Cider Vinegar 

* Spices: I flavor the chicken using smoked paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and salt. If cayenne is too spicy for you, use coarse ground pepper or more paprika instead. 

* Chicken Drumsticks: I suggest using drumsticks, but this recipe is just as tasty with bone-in chicken thighs. If using chicken thighs, consider increasing the cooking time some. The safe internal temperature for chicken is 165 degrees.
