#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Persian Cucumber: You can also use regular cucumbers, but I prefer these. To me, they are crisper than regular ones, and I love the crunch they add. 

* Tomato: I reach for the tomato medley for this salad, mostly for color, but use what you have - cherry tomatoes, grape tomatoes, or Roma tomatoes. 

* Cilantro 

* Olive Oil  

* Lime 

* Garlic 

* Salt and Pepper 

* Avocado 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [sharp knife](https://amzn.to/2R6C2Yp)

* A [salad bowl](https://amzn.to/33n2H61) 

#### I don't like cilantro; can I use something else? 

Sure, fresh dill is a great substitute. If you go this route, I suggest using lemon juice in place of the lime to compliment the flavor. 

#### What additions or changes could I make to this salad? 

* Slice fresh mozzarella to make an avocado, tomato, cucumber, and mozzarella salad, yum! 
* Corn
* Red onions
* Crumble feta cheese and add it for cucumber, tomato, avocado, feta salad
* Basil
* Make the salad a whole meal by adding canned salmon or tuna
* A bed of greens like spinach and arugula
