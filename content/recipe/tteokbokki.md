### ABOUT THE MEAL

Shariq and I gathered with international students from Malaysia and Burma. It was my first experience with Korean food; we ordered the meal family-style, as we often did so that everyone could try a little bit of everything. I fell in love with Korean food that day, but especially this spicy dish with a texture I had never experienced before- seriously, you have to try it! I should have had the foresight to ask them then what the name of the dish was, but of course, I did not. Instead, I went years in search of the tasty meal I tried that day. Here it is folks, tteokbokki. Also spelled, ddukbokki, ddeokbokki, dukbokki, or topokk depending on who you ask. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Rice Cakes: If you can find freshly made rice cakes where you live, that's always the best option. However, you can use refrigerated rice cakes or even frozen ones. 

* Fish Sauce: Traditionally, dried anchovies are used to make Tteokbokki brother, but since we always keep fish sauce in our home, I use that to flavor the broth and create umami instead. 

* Gochuchang

* Gochugaro 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A saucepan 

#### Is tteokbokki vegetarian? Is it vegan?

Yes, omit the fish sauce and use [Vegetable Better Than Bouillion](https://amzn.to/3ggLeni) to create the broth.
