### About the Dish 

This recipe teaches how to make Tteokbokki, also called Ddukbokki, Ddeokbokki, or Dukbokki; this dish is a popular Korean street food, and not only is it delicious, it's a comfort food that can easily be made at home.

My experience with tteokbokki began several years ago; Shariq and I were with friends from Malaysia and Burma in a small Korean restaurant in Arizona. It was my first time eating Korean food, and we ordered family-style. I fell in love with Korean food that day, but especially a spicy dish with a texture that sticks in your minds. I should have had the foresight to ask them the name of the dish, but of course, I did not. Instead, I went for years in search of this tasty meal. Here it is folks, tteokbokki, which I have eaten countless times now, and I am still a fan. 

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/32UtmKn): Traditionally, dried anchovies and kelp are used to make the Tteokbokki broth, but since fish sauce is a staple in our home, I use that to flavor the broth and create umami instead.

* [Chicken Better than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/2RGiSsu)

* Rice Cakes: If you can find freshly made rice cakes where you live, that's always the best option. However, you can use refrigerated or frozen rice cakes as well. 

* [Gochuchang](https://amzn.to/32A6v3v)

* [Gochugaro](https://amzn.to/3v0RhQT)
 
* White Sugar

* Scallions

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [saute pan](https://amzn.to/2RcOoyd)

#### Is Tteokbokki vegetarian? Is it vegan?

To make this particular recipe vegetarian and vegan, omit the fish sauce and use [Vegetable Better Than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/3ggLeni) and [Marmite](https://amzn.to/3xKVhYx) to flavor the broth.

#### Can I make Tteokbokki less spicy? 
 
Of course, reduce the amount of Gochuchang used to 2 tbsp and Gochugaro to 1 tsp. This way you still have all the flavor, but not all the spice. I also suggest increasing the amount of Better than Bouillon used to 2 tsp instead of 1. If you want a sweeter Tteokbokki, I suggest adding 1-2 tsp of honey to cut the heat and flavor the dish. 

#### What can I add to Tteokbokki? 

There are so many ways to dress up Tteokbokki. Many people enjoy adding fish cakes, boiled eggs, ramen, and vegetables like cabbage and carrots.
