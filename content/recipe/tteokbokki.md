### ABOUT THE MEAL

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Rice Cakes: If you can find freshly made rice cakes where you live, that's always the best option. However, you can use refrigerated rice cakes or even frozen ones. 

* Fish Sauce: I use this to flavor the broth and bring umami to the dish. Anchovy broth is used in traditional Tteokbokki, but I decided to use fish sauce, which is an ingredient I usually have in my pantry. 

* Gochuchang

* Gochugaro 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A saucepan 

#### Is tteokbokki vegetarian? Is it vegan?

Yes, simply omit the fish sauce and use [Vegetable Better Than Bouillion](https://amzn.to/3ggLeni) as a substitute for the broth.
