### ABOUT THE MEAL

Shariq and I gathered with international students from Malaysia and Burma in a small Korean restaurant in Arizona. It was my first experience with Korean food; we ordered the meal family-style, as we often did so that everyone could try a little bit of everything. I fell in love with Korean food that day, but especially this spicy dish with a texture I had never experienced before - seriously, you have to try it! I should have had the foresight to ask them the name of the dish, but of course, I did not. Instead, I went years in search of the tasty meal I tried that day. Here it is folks, Tteokbokki, which I have eaten countless times now, and I am still a fan. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Rice Cakes: If you can find freshly made rice cakes where you live, that's always the best option. However, you can use refrigerated or frozen rice cakes as well. 

* Fish Sauce: Traditionally, dried anchovies are used to make Tteokbokki, but since fish sauce is a staple in our home, I use that to flavor the broth and create umami instead.

#### Is Tteokbokki vegetarian? Is it vegan?

To make this particular recipe vegetarian and vegan, omit the fish sauce and use [Vegetable Better Than Bouillion](https://amzn.to/3ggLeni) to flavor the broth.

#### Can I make Tteokbokki less spicy? 
 
Of course, reduce the amount of Gochuchang used to 2 tbsp and Gochugaro to 1 tsp; this way, the flavor is there, but not all the spice. I also suggest increasing the amount of Better than Bouillon used to 2 tsp instead of 1. If you want a sweeter Tteokbokki, add 1-2 tsp of honey to cut the heat and flavor the dish. 

#### What can I add to Tteokbokki? 

There are so many ways to dress up Tteokbokki. Many people enjoy adding fish cakes, boiled eggs, ramen, and vegetables like cabbage and carrots.
