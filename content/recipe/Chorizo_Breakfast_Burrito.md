Servings: 5 Burritos <!--more-->

Preparation Time: 40 minutes

Cuisine: Mexican American 

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 3 Red Potatoes, peeled and cubed 
* 1 tbsp Avocado Oil 
* 1 lb Chorizo 
* 4 Scallions, green parts, chopped 
* 6 large Eggs 
* 5 large Flour Tortillas 
* ½ cup Shredded Cheese 
* ½ Yellow Onion, diced 
* 1 tsp Garlic Powder 
* Salt, to taste

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Warm oil in a frying pan over medium heat and add the white onions and potatoes. Cover the pan with a lid and cook until tender, stirring occasionally to prevent onion or potatoes from sticking to the pan. 
2. Remove the lid and cook until the potatoes turn golden brown. 
3. Add the scallions and stir for 30 seconds until combined. 
4. In a small bowl, combine the eggs, salt, and garlic powder. 
5. Add both the chorizo and the egg mixture to the skillet and bring to a soft scramble. 
6. Warm tortillas on a pan, about 30 seconds on both sides. 
7. Divide the chorizo mixture into each tortilla, sprinkle with cheese, and serve.
