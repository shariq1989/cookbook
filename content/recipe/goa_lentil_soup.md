### ABOUT THE MEAL 

Goa is a coastal city and happens to be the smallest state in India. The food they make is unique to their region; Goan cuisine is well known for its balance of sweet and spicy, and its inclusion of coconut and seafood in many of their dishes. I hope you enjoy this Goa masoor dal recipe our family loves.

#### What ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Coconut Oil: Coconut is a central ingredient in Goan cuisine; they use every part of the coconut in their cooking- the oil, milk, and meat are all featured. I use coconut oil and coconut milk to flavor the dal.  

* Onion 

* Garlic 

* Ginger 

* Boriya Chillies 

* Spices: I use salt, black mustard seed, turmeric, coriander powder, and ground fennel to flavor the dal. 

* Full-Fat [Coconut Milk](https://amzn.to/3cEP2vg): Coconut is a central ingredient in Goan cuisine; they use every part of the coconut in their cooking- the oil, milk, and meat are all featured. I use coconut oil and coconut milk to flavor the dal.  

* [Red Lentils-Masoor Dal](https://amzn.to/3qmuduc): Dal, otherwise spelled daal or dahl, means lentil in Hindi. Masoor dal has an orange or red color when dry, but the color changes to bright yellow once cooked. Other varieties of dal break down differently during the cooking process. Be sure to use red lentils as they break down entirely as they cook and lend the perfect consistency to the dal. While cooking, be sure to check the dal every so often and give it a quick stir to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Overcooked dal is mushy, and undercooked dal is crunchy, much like a seed. You want the dal to be tender but still have substance.

* Spinach 

* Lime 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [colander](https://amzn.to/3pbS1kS)  
* A [saute pan](https://amzn.to/3lcbe51) with a lid or [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ)

#### Is Goa red dal vegetarian? Is it vegan? 

This dish is tasty and vegetarian and vegan-friendly. 

#### Can I freeze the Goa red dal?

Yes, first allow the dal to cool and gather several freezer-safe bags. Scoop a small amount of dal into each bag, careful to leave a few inches of space so the dish can expand if needed. Squeeze out as much air as you can before sealing the bags. Moong Dal will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your side dishes.
