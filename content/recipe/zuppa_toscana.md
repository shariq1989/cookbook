### About the Meal 

There are way too many versions of this favorite Olive Garden soup floating around the internet, and honestly, it makes sense! Zuppa Toscana is delicious. Before making the soup at home, it was the only reason I went to Olive Garden. Well, that and the breadsticks. This Olive Garden Zuppa Toscana is the ultimate comfort food. It is creamy and loaded with sausage, potatoes, and bright, crisp kale; it is tasty and filling. I hope you enjoy our family's take on Olive Garden Zuppa Toscana.

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Ground Italian Sausage: Control the heat by using mild or spicy Italian sausage. I prefer to switch it up depending on who we serve, though I am partial to a bit of spice.

* Onion

* Garlic 

* [Chicken Better than Bouillon]

* Potatoes: I use red, Yukon, or a combination of the two.

* Oregano

* Garlic Powder

* Black Pepper

* Kosher Salt

* Heavy Cream: I love how creamy and filling this soup is with the heavy cream. You could easily substitute half-in-half or a non-dairy alternative like coconut cream if you prefer.   

* Kale: The brightness of the kale is my favorite part of this soup. Be sure to remove the stems and chop the kale to your liking. I prefer larger pieces, but it is totally up to you. 

* Fresh Parmesan Cheese

* Bacon: Adding crumbled, crispy bacon is a tasty addition to the soup; I chose to leave it out of this recipe since the meal is already pretty high in fat. I have tried it both ways, and the bacon brings extra flavor to the rest of the soup, for sure. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe? 

* A [Dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3sFYTY1), [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3w5GDtJ), or [Crockpot](https://amzn.to/3zIa7hR) 
* A [skillet](https://amzn.to/3xyWEtj)

#### Can I make vegatarian Zuppa Toscana? 

Yes, I suggest doubling the vegetables by adding more potatoes and kale. You could include carrots or cauliflower. As another option, you could use an alternative like Beyond Sausage. It comes in sweet Italian and hot Italian to fit your preferences. Instead of the Chicken Better than Bouillon, use their [vegetable](https://amzn.to/3kK88Fi) option. 

#### Can I make Zuppa Toscana vegan? 

Like the vegetarian options above, replace the meat with more vegetables by doubling the potatoes and kale. You could include carrots or cauliflower. Additionally, you can use an alternative like Beyond Sausage. It comes in sweet Italian and hot Italian to fit your preferences. Instead of the Chicken Better than Bouillon, use their [vegetable](https://amzn.to/3kK88Fi) option. Replace the heavy cream with full-fat [coconut cream](https://amzn.to/3ufLoA8), and skip the parmesan cheese. With these modifications, you will have a tasty, vegan Zuppa Toscana. 

#### Can I freeze Zuppa Toscana? 

You sure can. First, allow the soup to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. Zuppa Toscana will freeze for up to 3 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm the soup on a stove or in the microwave, and enjoy!
