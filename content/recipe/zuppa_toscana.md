### About the Meal 

It's safe to say Zuppa Toscana is Olive Garden's most popular soup. For this reason, there are way too many versions of this Olive Garden favorite floating around the internet. Our recipe for Olive Garden Zuppa Toscana is the ultimate comfort food. It is creamy and loaded with sausage, potatoes, and bright, crisp kale. I hope you enjoy our family's take on this better than Olive Garden Zuppa Toscana.

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Ground Italian Sausage: Control the heat of the soup by using mild or spicy Italian sausage. I switch it up depending on who we are serving, though I am partial to a bit of spice.

* Onion

* Garlic: I suggest using four cloves, but don't my recipe tell you how much garlic to add- go for it.

* [Chicken Better than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/38081yU): I use Better Than Bouillion in place of chicken stock for this recipe. It's flavorful, easy, and something I always keep in my pantry. 

* Potatoes: I use red, Yukon, or a combination of the two.

* Oregano

* Garlic Powder

* Black Pepper

* Kosher Salt

* Heavy Cream: I love how creamy and filling this soup is using heavy cream. You can easily substitute half-in-half for less calories or use a non-dairy alternative like coconut cream if you prefer.   

* Kale: The brightness of the kale is my favorite part of this soup. Be sure to remove the stems and chop the kale. I prefer larger pieces, but it is totally up to you. 

* Parmesan Cheese

* Bacon: Adding crumbled, crispy bacon is a tasty addition to the soup; I chose to leave it out of this recipe since the meal is already pretty high in fat. I have tried it both ways, and the bacon brings extra flavor to the rest of the soup, though I don't think it is necessary. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe? 

* A [Dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3sFYTY1), [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3w5GDtJ), or [Crockpot](https://amzn.to/3zIa7hR) 
* A [skillet](https://amzn.to/3xyWEtj) if using a Crockpot. 

#### Can I make vegatarian Zuppa Toscana? 

You sure can. I suggest doubling the vegetables by adding more potatoes and kale. You can also include carrots or cauliflower. As another option, use Beyond Sausage in place of meat in this recipe. It comes in sweet Italian and hot Italian to fit your preference. Instead of the Chicken Better than Bouillon, use their [vegetable](https://amzn.to/3kK88Fi) option. 

#### Can I make Zuppa Toscana vegan? 

Like the vegetarian options above, replace the meat with more vegetables by doubling the potatoes and kale, or including carrots and cauliflower. Additionally, you can use an alternative like Beyond Sausage. It comes in sweet Italian and hot Italian to fit your preferences. Instead of the Chicken Better than Bouillon, use their [vegetable](https://amzn.to/3kK88Fi) option. Replace the heavy cream with full-fat [coconut cream](https://amzn.to/3ufLoA8), and skip the parmesan cheese. With these modifications, you will have a tasty, vegan Zuppa Toscana. 

#### Can I freeze Zuppa Toscana? 

You sure can. First, allow the soup to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. Zuppa Toscana will freeze for up to 3 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm the soup on a stove or in the microwave, and enjoy!
