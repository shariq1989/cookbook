### ABOUT THE MEAL

There are multiple versions of this recipe floating around the internet. Honestly, it makes sense. Zuppa Toscana is tasty! Before learning to make it at home, it was the only reason I went to Olive Garden. Well, that and the breadsticks,

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Ground Italian Sausage: Control the heat using mild or spicy Italian sausage. We prefer to switch it up depending on who we are serving.

* Heavy Cream: I use heavy cream, but you could easily substitute half-in-half or coconut milk.  

* Kale: Remove the stems and chop the kale. I prefer larger pieces, but it is totally up to your preferences. 

* Potato: I use red or Yukon. 

* Bacon: Adding in some crumbled, crispy bacon is a tasty addition to this dish. I chose to leave it out personally since the meal is already high in fat. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe? 

* A [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3sFYTY1) or an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3w5GDtJ)

#### Is zuppa toscana keto? Is it low-carb? 

The macros are a little high for a keto diet. However, with one substitution, Zuppa Toscana fits a low-carb diet well. Simply, replace the red potatoes with cauliflower. Cauliflower takes on a potato-like texture when cooked, and you still get all the flavor of the original recipe. I calculated the macros to make it easy for you.

* CARBS– 13 net carbs
* PROTEIN– 62g
* FAT– 61g

You can also substitute half-and-half for the heavy cream to reduce the carbs and calories for this meal if you choose. 

#### Can I freeze Zuppa Toscana? 

Yes, first allow the dish to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container. Zuppa Toscana will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm the soup on a stove and enjoy.
