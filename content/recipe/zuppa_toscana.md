### ABOUT THE MEAL

There are way too many versions of this recipe floating around the internet, and honestly, it makes sense! Zuppa Toscana is good. Before learning to make it at home, it was the only reason I ever went to Olive Garden. Well, that and the breadsticks. 

Olive Garden Zuppa Toscana is comfort food at its best. It is creamy and loaded with sausage, potatoes, and bright, crisp kale. This recipe is so delicious and filling; the whole family will enjoy it.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Ground Italian Sausage: Control the heat using mild or spicy Italian sausage. We prefer to switch it up depending on who we are serving.

* Heavy Cream: I love how creamy this soup is with the heavy cream, but you could easily substitute half-in-half if you prefer.  

* Kale: The brightness of the kale is my favorite part of this recipe. Be sure to remove the stems and then chop the kale to your preference. I like having larger pieces, but it is totally up to you. 

* Potatoes: I use red or Yukon. 

* Bacon: Adding in some crumbled, crispy bacon is a tasty addition to this dish. I chose to leave it out personally since the meal is already high in fat.
