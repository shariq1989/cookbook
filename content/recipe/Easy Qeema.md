#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1/2 tbsp [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW) 
* 1 lb Ground Beef, finely minced 
* 3-4 small Red Potatoes, finely chopped 
* 1/2 Yellow Onion, finely chopped 
* 1-inch piece Ginger, peeled and finely minced, plus more for garnish
* 1-2 Thai Green Chili, slit lengthwise 
* 1 medium Tomato, pureed 
* 1/2 package [Laziza Qeema Masala](https://amzn.to/3b4Y4B0)
* 1/2 cup Cilantro, chopped
* 1 Serrano Chili, finely sliced, for garnish
* Salt, to taste 

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Heat ghee over medium heat in two large, heavy-bottomed skillets.  
2. In the first pan, add the diced potatoes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until they become golden brown, about 15 minutes. Set aside.
3. In the other pan, fry the onions, garlic, ginger, and chili until onions become translucent and soften for about 5 minutes. 
4. Add the Qeema Masala, stir to coat, and continue cooking for another minute.
5. Next add the ground beef, breaking it up with a meat chopper until it becomes finely minced. Cook until the beef is fulled browned, about 8 minutes. 
6. Add the tomatoes and turn up the heat until the mixture bubbles. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. 
7. Stir in the reserved potatoes, 1/2 cup cilantro and salt, to taste. 
8. Garnish with ginger and serrano chili slices and serve with long-grain basmati rice or naan. 

#### ABOUT THE MEAL 

This recipe is for an easy and delicious Pakistani qeema. Qeema is perfect for those busy nights where you don't have a lot of time, but you still want to make something tasty. For this recipe, we included potatoes. When we make this at home, we often leave them out entirely. The choice is up to you. If making this dish for guests, I highly recommend including the potatoes and maybe even adding peas for a little body. 

Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with Desi food. If you asked me about the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry, I couldn’t have told you, so learning how to cook Indian food is near and dear to my heart. It's been an honor to study Desi cooking under my talented mother-in-law. She prepares food off-script and you have to watch her closely as she buzzes through the kitchen, or you miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build upon flavors and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by what I have learned cooking alongside her.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* 2 Heavy-bottomed pans with lids 
* A meat chopper

#### Can I freeze qeema?
Yes, first allow the qeema to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container. To prevent freezer burn, you can also layer saran wrap over the container before securing the lid. Qeema will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your side dishes.
