#### THE STORY BEHIND THE MEAL 

Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with eating or making Desi food. If you asked me the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry I couldnâ€™t have told you. Now, I am incredibly honored to be able to study Desi cooking under my mother-in-law. She cooks off-script so I have to carefully observe her as she buzzes through the kitchen or I miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build flavor and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by her cooking, though I am sure hers would be even tastier.
