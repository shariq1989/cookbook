#### ABOUT THE MEAL 

Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with Desi food. If you asked me about the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry, I couldnâ€™t have told you, so learning how to cook Indian food is near and dear to my heart. It's been an honor to study Desi cooking under my talented mother-in-law. She prepares food off-script and you have to watch her closely as she buzzes through the kitchen, or you miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build upon flavors and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by what I have learned cooking alongside her.
