#### INGREDIENTS 

* 3-4 Chinese Eggplant, cut into 1-inch pieces 
* 2 tsp Kosher Salt
* 2 tsp Cornstarch
* 2 tbsp Avocado Oil 
* 5 Garlic Cloves, minced 
* 1 tbsp Fresh Ginger, minced 
* 3-5 Chilis De Arbol, dried 
* 4 Green Onion, thinly sliced 

For the Sauce: 
* 3 tbsp Soy Sauce

#### INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a small bowl, whisk together the ingredients for the sauce. Set aside. 
2. Cut the eggplant into 1-inch pieces and place them into a bowl. Toss with salt and let them sit for about 10 minutes.

4. In a heavy-bottomed pan or a wok, warm the avocado oil over medium-high heat.
