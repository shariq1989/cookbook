Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with Desi food. If you asked me the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry, I couldn’t have told you, so learning how to cook Indian food is near and dear to my heart. It’s been an honor to study Desi cooking under my talented mother-in-law. She prepares food off-script; you have to watch her closely as she buzzes through the kitchen, or you miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build upon flavors and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by what I have learned cooking alongside her.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Full-fat yogurt 

* Cilantro 

* Cucumber 

* Spices: I like to use salt and cumin. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe? 

* A small bowl
* A food processor or blender

#### Can I make raita vegan? Can I make it dairy-free? 

It It may change the taste slightly, but you can absolutely make this recipe with coconut-based yogurt instead. 

#### What can I do with leftover raita? 

I don't recommend freezing leftover raita, but it doesn't have to go to waste. You could use the leftovers to top a burger, as a dipping sauce, or as a salad dressing. You could also mix it with leftover rice and eat it as is, or use it as dressing for a pita.
