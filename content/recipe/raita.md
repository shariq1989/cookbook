#### ABOUT THE SAUCE 

Raita pairs well with Indian dishes like biryani, tandoori chicken, pulao, and channa masala. I also eat it with Persian kebabs and use it as a dressing for salad.

Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with Desi food. If you asked me about the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry, I couldn’t have told you, so learning how to cook Indian food is near and dear to my heart. It's been an honor to study Desi cooking under my talented mother-in-law. She prepares food off-script and you have to watch her closely as she buzzes through the kitchen, or you miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build upon flavors and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by what I have learned cooking alongside her.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe? 

* A small bowl
* A food processor or blender
* A knife and cutting board

#### What can I do with my leftover raita? 

There are several ways to re-purpose raita, here are a few that come to my mind off the top of my head: use it as a topping for a burger, a veggie, or chip dip, a salad dressing, mix it with leftover rice, or use it as dressing for a pita.
