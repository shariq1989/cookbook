#### ABOUT THE MEAL 

Raita pairs well with Indian dishes like biryani, tandoori chicken, pulao, and channa masala. I also eat it with Persian kebabs and use it as a dressing for salad.

Learning to make Indian food is near and dear to my heart. Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with eating or making Desi food. If you asked me back then what the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry, I couldn’t have told you. Since then, it has been an honor to study under my mother-in-law, who happens to be a phenomenal cook. She makes meals off-script so you have to watch her closely as she buzzes through the kitchen or you will miss it all. I am continually amazed by her ability to build upon flavors and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by what I have learned cooking alongside her.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe? 

You will need a food processor or blender.
