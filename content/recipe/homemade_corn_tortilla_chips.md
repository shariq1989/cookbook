Servings: About 70 Chips <!--more-->

Preparation Time: 5 minutes

Cooking Time: 25 minutes

Cuisine: Mexican

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 2 cups Coconut Oil 
* 12 Corn Tortillas, cut into six wedges 
* Kosher Salt, to taste
  
#### STOVE-TOP INSTRUSTIONS

1. Gather the corn tortillas and cut them into six wedges. Set aside. 
2. Prepare a rimmed baking sheet with a wire rack. I cover the baking sheet with a cloth for easy cleanup. 
3. Add coconut oil to a large frying pan, about 1/4-inches deep. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it begins to smoke. Then reduce the heat to medium to prevent burning. You will have to adjust the heat back and forth throughout this process. 
4. Add the tortillas in a single layer to the oil without overlapping.  Fry for 1 minute and flip, and then fry for another minute until the tortillas are lightly golden and crisp.
5. With a pair of tongs, remove the tortilla chips and place them onto the wire rack to drain. Sprinkle evenly with Kosher salt while they are still hot. When the chips have had an opportunity to drain, add them to a large serving bowl to make room for the other chips.
6. Repeat with the remaining tortilla chips until all have had a chance to fry.

#### OVEN INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 
2. Prepare two rimmed baking sheets.
3. Gather the corn tortillas and brush both sides of each tortilla with coconut oil. Then, stack the tortillas cut them into six wedges. Set aside. 
4. Add the tortillas in a single layer onto the prepared baking sheets. 
5. Bake the chips for 7-10 minutes. Then, rotate the pans and continue cooking them for another 7-10 minutes. 
6. While the tortillas are still piping hot, sprinkle them with salt and then set them aside to cool.

### ABOUT THE SIDE

If forced to eat one food for the rest of my life, I would likely choose chips and salsa, specifically with these chips. They are a favorite in our home, not just of mine, but our children also. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Corn Tortillas: Our family loves corn tortilla chips; you could also use blue corn or flour tortillas instead. 

* Coconut Oil: I love the added flavor of the coconut oil, but you can use your preferred oil. However,  choose an oil with a high smoke point since you are frying the tortillas. I suggest using avocado oil or vegetable oil. You can also use canola oil, grapeseed oil, or sunflower oil.

* Salt: I use Kosher salt because that is something I always have in my pantry, but you could use sea salt. Both will give you the restaurant-quality salt experience we know and love.

* A large [frying pan](https://amzn.to/33DLdCB)

#### What are some other ways I could flavor the chips? 

* [Tajin](https://amzn.to/2Srx09c): I am from Arizona, so this blend is a staple in our pantry. The chili-lime flavor of Tajin is great on tortilla chips.  

* Lime: Add zest and juice of a lime over the chips and toss for a citrus tang.

* Sweetener: Want to try something a little adventurous? Try our dessert chips using the same tortilla chips found in this recipe. 

#### What is the best way to store leftover chips? 

Should you have leftovers, these chips store well in a paper bag or an airtight container on your countertop. They will last for up to one week, but I highly recommend eating them the same day for the best results.
