#### INGREDIENTS 

* ⅓ cup Soy Sauce 
* 3 tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar 
* 4 tbsp White Sugar, divided 
* 2 large Eggs Whites, lightly beaten 
* 2 lb Chicken Thighs, skinless and cut into 1 inch pieces 
* 2 cup Corn Starch
* ½ cup Sichuan Peppers, toasted and finely ground 
* 2 tsp Kosher Salt 
* 2 qt Vegetable Oil 
* 8 Scallion, greens thinly sliced
* 1 cup Cilantro Leaves, chopped 
* 6 tbsp Sichuan Oil 
* 1 tbsp Sichuan Seasoning Salt 


#### DIRECTIONS 
1. In a large bowl, combine soy sauce, vinegar, 2 tbsp sugar, and the egg whites. Stir until sugar dissolves. 
2. Add chicken to the mixture and stir to coat, cover and let marinate for 20-30 minutes.  
3. Meanwhile, set 2 wire racks into 2 rimmed baking sheets. 
4. In a large bowl, stir together 2 tbsp sugar, cornstarch, sichuan peppers, and salt. 
5. Drain chicken in a colander. 
6. Add ⅓ of the chicken to the cornstarch and toss to coat completely, pressing the pieces into the mixture. 
7. Transfer coated chicken to a mesh strainer and shake to remove excess cornstarch. Transfer to the prepared rack in a single layer and repeat with the remaining chicken and cornstarch mixture. 
8. In a large dutch oven, over medium heat, heat the oil to 350 degrees. Add half of the coated chicken and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until well browned, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to the other wire rack. 
9. Allow the oil to reach 350 degrees again and repeat with the remaining chicken. 
10. In a small bowl, microwave the sichuan chili oil for 30 seconds.
11. Combine the hot fried chicken and scallions in a large bowl, sprinkle with sichuan seasoning salt and drizzle with the warm chili oil, then toss to coat. 
12. Add cilantro and toss again. 
13. Serve with additional chili oil.
