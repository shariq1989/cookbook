#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Marinade: 

* ⅓ cup Dark Soy Sauce 
* 3 tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar 
* 2 tbsp White Sugar
* 2 large Eggs Whites, lightly beaten 

For the Fried Chicken:

* 2 lb Chicken Thighs, skinless, boneless, cut into 1-inch pieces 
* 1 tsp Kosher Salt
* 2 cup Corn Starch
* 2 qt Canola Oil 

For the Dish: 

* 1 tbsp Chili Oil 
* 1 tbsp Canola Oil
* 1 cup Red Arbol Chilis, dried, to taste
* 1 Ginger, 1-inch piece, julienne
* 4 Garlic Cloves, julienne
* 1/2 tsp Sugar 
* 1 tsp Rice Wine Vinegar
* 8 Scallion, thinly sliced
* 1 tsp Toasted Sesame Seeds


#### DIRECTIONS 
1. In a large bowl, combine the ingredients for the marinade: soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and egg whites. Stir until sugar dissolves. Add the chicken to the bowl and stir to coat, cover and let it marinate for 30 minutes.  
2. Meanwhile, set 2 wire racks into 2 rimmed baking sheets. 
3. In another large bowl, stir together the cornstarch and salt. 
4. Get the marinated chicken and leave it to drain in a colander, about 1-2 minutes. 
5. Add ⅓ of the chicken to the cornstarch and toss to coat completely, pressing the pieces into the mixture. Shake the pieces to remove any excess cornstarch and transfer them to the prepared rack in a single layer and repeat with the remaining chicken and cornstarch mixture. 
6. In a large dutch oven, over medium heat, heat the oil to 350 degrees. Add half of the coated chicken in a single layer and cook until it becomes brown, about 5 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to the other prepared wire rack. 
7. Allow the oil to reach 350 degrees again and repeat with the remaining chicken. 
8. In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat the chili oil, canola oil, Arbol chilis, garlic, ginger, sugar, and rice wine vinegar for about 3 minutes. Add the chicken to the mixture and toss to combine. 
10. Finish the dish with scallions and serve with jasmine rice.
