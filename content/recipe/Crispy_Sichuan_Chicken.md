Servings: 4 <!--more-->

Marinating Time: 30 Minutes 

Cook Time: 40 minutes

Cuisine: Chinese, Sichuan  

#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Marinade: 

* ⅓ cup Dark Soy Sauce 
* 3 tbsp [Shaoxing Wine](https://amzn.to/3lmuDiq)
* 2 tbsp White Sugar
* 2 large Eggs Whites, lightly beaten 

For the Fried Chicken:

* 2 lb Chicken Thighs, skinless and boneless, cut into 1-inch pieces 
* 1 tsp Kosher Salt
* 2 cup Corn Starch
* 2 qt Canola Oil 

For the Dish: 

* 1 tbsp [Chili Oil](https://amzn.to/3lo3sUi)
* 1 tbsp Canola Oil
* 1 tsp [Sichuan Chilis](https://amzn.to/2OEuomZ), dried
* 1 cup Red [Arbol Chilis](https://amzn.to/3c4M7M9), dried
* 1-inch Fresh Ginger, peeled and julienne
* 4 Garlic Cloves, julienne
* 1/2 tsp Sugar 
* 1 tsp [Shaoxing Wine](ht]tps://amzn.to/3lmuDiq)
* 8 Scallion, thinly sliced
* 1 tsp Toasted Sesame Seeds

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a large bowl, combine the ingredients for the marinade: soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and egg whites. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Add the chicken to the bowl and stir to coat, cover, and let the meat marinate for 30 minutes.  
2. Meanwhile, set the wire racks into the rimmed baking sheets. 
3. In another large bowl, mix the cornstarch and salt. 
4. Retrieve the marinated chicken and leave it to drain in a colander, 1-2 minutes. 
5. Add ⅓ of the chicken to the cornstarch and toss to coat, pressing the pieces into the mixture. Shake the chicken pieces to remove any excess cornstarch and transfer them to one of the prepared racks. Repeat with the remaining chicken and cornstarch mixture. 
6. In a [large dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3bVhcBR), over medium heat, warm the oil to 350 degrees. Add half of the coated chicken in a single layer and cook until both sides brown, about 3-5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to the other prepared wire rack. 
7. Allow the oil to reach 350 degrees again and repeat with the remaining chicken. 
8. In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat the chili oil, canola oil, Arbol chilis, and Sichuan chilis until they begin to sputter. 
9. Next, add the garlic, ginger, sugar, and rice wine vinegar. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring regularly. 
10. Add the fried chicken to the mixture and toss to combine. 
11. Garnish with scallions and serve with jasmine rice. 

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

In Chinese, Laziji means dried chili pepper chicken, and when you see pictures of Chongqing laziji, or mala chicken you know why. Although this dish looks like it will light a fire in your mouth, it's not actually that hot unless you decide to break up the chilis during the cooking process or bite into them as I do.

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?
* Chicken Thighs: We use boneless chicken thighs cut into bit-size pieces because it is easier, but traditionally it is made with a whole chicken. 

* Dried Red Chilis: Dried red chilis are the star of this recipe, as you can see in the photos. I try to balance the chicken to chili ratio, in large part, because I cannot handle it otherwise. You can most certainly use more or fewer chilis based on your personal preference. I also cook the chilis whole rather than cutting them up, as other versions of this recipe will do. 

* Sichuan Chilis

* Scallions: I like to cook the whites of the scallions with the chicken to balance the heat, and then top the dish with the scallion greens to give it a bite and a touch of freshness. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* 2 Large bowls
* 2 Rimmed baking sheets
* 2 Wire racks
* A colander
* A [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3bVhcBR)
* A [food thermometer](https://amzn.to/3cAXtHU)
* A slotted spoon
* A heavy-bottomed pan

#### Can I make this recipe gluten-free?

Yes, replace the all-purpose flour with [chickpea flour](https://amzn.to/30F0Vf2) or add more cornstarch. Also, substitute [tamari sauce](https://amzn.to/30F0uBo) in place of soy sauce.

#### Can I freeze the Chongqing Laziji?

Yes, if you plan to freeze the Chongqing Laziji, be sure to keep the chicken and sauce separate except when dishing up individual plates. Freeze the sauce and chicken separately in freezer-safe containers. When you’re ready to eat, let them defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, reheat the chicken in the oven and warm the sauce in a pan. Toss the chicken with the sauce and enjoy.
