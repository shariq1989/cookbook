Servings: 4 <!--more-->

Marinating Time: 30 Minutes 

Cook Time: 40 minutes

Cuisine: Chinese, Sichuan  

#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Marinade: 

* ⅓ cup Dark Soy Sauce 
* 3 tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar 
* 2 tbsp White Sugar
* 2 large Eggs Whites, lightly beaten 

For the Fried Chicken:

* 2 lb Chicken Thighs, skinless and boneless, cut into 1-inch pieces 
* 1 tsp Kosher Salt
* 2 cup Corn Starch
* 2 qt Canola Oil 

For the Dish: 

* 1 tbsp Chili Oil 
* 1 tbsp Canola Oil
* 1 tsp Sichuan Chilis, dried
* 1 cup Red [Arbol Chilis](https://amzn.to/3c4M7M9), dried
* 1-inch Fresh Ginger, peeled and julienne
* 4 Garlic Cloves, julienne
* 1/2 tsp Sugar 
* 1 tsp Rice Wine Vinegar
* 8 Scallion, thinly sliced
* 1 tsp Toasted Sesame Seeds

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a large bowl, combine the ingredients for the marinade: soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and egg whites. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Add the chicken to the bowl and stir to coat, cover, and let the meat marinate for 30 minutes.  
2. Meanwhile, set the wire racks into the rimmed baking sheets. 
3. In another large bowl, mix the cornstarch and salt. 
4. Retrieve the marinated chicken and leave it to drain in a colander, 1-2 minutes. 
5. Add ⅓ of the chicken to the cornstarch and toss to coat, pressing the pieces into the mixture. Shake the chicken pieces to remove any excess cornstarch and transfer them to one of the prepared racks. Repeat with the remaining chicken and cornstarch mixture. 
6. In a [large dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3bVhcBR), over medium heat, warm the oil to 350 degrees. Add half of the coated chicken in a single layer and cook until both sides brown, about 3-5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to the other prepared wire rack. 
7. Allow the oil to reach 350 degrees again and repeat with the remaining chicken. 
8. In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat the chili oil, canola oil, Arbol chilis, and Sichuan chilis until they begin to sputter. 
9. Next, add the garlic, ginger, sugar, and rice wine vinegar. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring regularly. 
10. Add the fried chicken to the mixture and toss to combine. 
11. Garnish with scallions and serve with jasmine rice.
