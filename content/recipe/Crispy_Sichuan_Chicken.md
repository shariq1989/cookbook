#### INGREDIENTS 

* ⅓ Cup Soy Sauce 
* 3 Tbsp. Rice Wine Vinegar 
* 4 Tbsp. White Sugar, divided 
* 2 Large Eggs Whites, lightly beaten 
* 2 Lbs. Chicken Thighs, skinless and cut into 1 in. pieces 
* 2 Cups Corn Starch
* ½ Cup Sichuan Peppers, toasted and finely ground 
* 2 Tsp. Kosher Salt 
* 2 Qts. Peanut Oil 
* 8 Scallion, thinly sliced at an angle 
* 1 Cup Cilantro Leaves, chopped 
* 6 Tbsp. Sichuan Oil 
* 1 Tbsp. Sichuan Seasoning Salt 


#### DIRECTIONS 
1. In a large bowl, combine soy sauce, vinegar, 2 Tbsp. sugar, and the egg whites. Stir until sugar dissolves. 
2. Add chicken to the mixture and stir to coat, cover and let marinate for 20-30 min. 
3. Meanwhile, set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet. 
4. In a large bowl, stir together 2 Tbsp. sugar, cornstarch, sichuan peppers, and salt. 
5. Drain chicken in a colander. 
6. Add ⅓ of the chicken to the cornstarch and toss to coat completely, pressing the pieces into the mixture. 
7. Transfer coated chicken to a mesh strainer and shake to remove excess cornstarch. Transfer to the prepared rack in a single layer and repeat with the remaining chicken and cornstarch mixture. 
8. In a large dutch oven, over medium heat, heat the peanut oil to 350 degrees. Add half of the coated chicken and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until well browned, about 5 min. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to another wire rack. 
9. Allow the oil to reach 350 degrees again and repeat with the remaining chicken. 
10. In a small bowl, microwave the sichuan chili oil for 30 sec. 
11. Combine the hot fried chicken and scallions in a large bowl, sprinkle with sichuan seasoning salt and drizzle with the warm chili oil, then toss to coat. 
12. Add cilantro and toss again. 
13. Serve with additional chili oil.
