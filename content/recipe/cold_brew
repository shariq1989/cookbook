### ABOUT THE COFFEE

Everyone has their favorite banana bread recipe; this is mine. 

#### What main ingredients are needed for this bread?

* Over-Ripe Bananas: You will want to use bananas that have gotten to the point where they have developed freckles and have become just a little too soft to want to snack on. The riper the banana, the more richly banana-flavored your bread will become.

#### Can I make this banana bread vegan?

To make this banana bread vegan, you will need to make a few substitutions: 

* Eggs: Use flax eggs, but reduce the eggs amount to two eggs. I don't have a recipe written out, but the ratio for flax eggs is: one tbsp of flaxseed and three tbsp of water 

* Butter: Opt for vegan butter or coconut oil. 

* Milk: Use almond milk, coconut milk, or water instead. 

#### How should I store my banana bread? 

To keep your banana bread moist, allow it to cool completely and wrap it in a layer of saran wrap. Then, store it in a Ziploc bag or a container with a tight-fitting lid. It will last on the counter for up to 3 days. 

#### What can I add to my banana bread?

* Chocolate chips 
* Nuts: Walnuts, Pecans
* Peanut Butter 
* Spices: Nutmeg, All Spice
* Maple Syrup 
* Cocao Powder
* Orange Zest 
* Dried Fruit: Cranberries, Raisins, apricots
* Pumpkin Puree 

#### Can I freeze banana bread?

You sure can. First, allow the banana bread to cool completely and then wrap it in saran wrap, followed by aluminum foil. The banana bread will freeze for up to 2 months. When you're ready to eat, let it defrost at room temperature. This process can take up to 24 hours.
