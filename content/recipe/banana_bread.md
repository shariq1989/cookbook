### ABOUT THE BREAD 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this bread?

* Over-Ripe Bananas: Use bananas that have begun to freckle and are a little too soft to snack on. The riper the banana, the richer the banana-flavor will become. 

* Unsalted Butter: Other banana bread recipes use oil, but I enjoy the flavor and texture butter lends to the bread. 

* Sugar: I use a mix of brown and white sugar for this recipe. 

* Eggs & Milk: I use eggs and milk to bind everything together.

* All-Purpose Flour

* Baking Soda & Baking Powder

* Cinnamon: Cinnamon is optional, but I think it balances the flavors well and adds a rich brown coloring to the bread. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large bowl
* A small bowl
* 2- 9x5 [loaf pans](https://amzn.to/3lhGhv0)

#### What can I add to my banana bread?

* Chocolate chips 
* Nuts: Walnuts, Pecans
* Peanut Butter 
* Spices: Nutmeg, All Spice
* Maple Syrup 
* Cocao Powder
* Orange Zest 
* Dried Fruit: Cranberries, Raisins, apricots
* Pumpkin Puree 

#### How should I store banana bread? 

To keep your banana bread moist, allow it to cool completely and then wrap it in a layer of plastic wrap. Then, store it in a Ziploc bag or a container with a tight-fitting lid. It will last on the counter for up to 3 days. 

#### Can I freeze the banana bread?

You sure can. First, allow the banana bread to cool completely and then wrap it in plastic wrap, followed by aluminum foil. The banana bread will freeze for up to 2 months. When you're ready to eat, let it defrost at room temperature.
