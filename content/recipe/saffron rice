Preparation Time: 30 minutes <!--more-->
Servings: 3-4 
Cuisine: Persian 

#### INGREDIENTS 


#### DIRECTIONS 
1. Rinse the basmati rice until the water runs clear. Then soak for 20 minutes. Drain and rinse once more. 
2. While waiting on the rice, add the saffron to a small bowl. Using a spoon, break down the stems into smaller pieces. Add boiling hot water or milk to it and let it sit for 5 minutes. 
Soak the saffron threads in warm liquid. This will help to open up the spice and release its floral flavor. For quick results, I microwave the saffron threads and 1 Tablespoon water for 20-30 seconds. Alternatively, pour 1 Tablespoon boiling water over the saffron threads and allow them to bloom for 5 minutes.
Add rinsed and drained rice and all other ingredients in the inner pot of the Instant Pot. Close the lid and set the valve to sealing position. Cook on Manual/Pressure Cook for 6 minutes at high pressure.
Wait 5 minutes before manually releasing the pressure (NPR 5). Open the lid after the pin drops. Using a fork carefully fluff the rice and serve warm.


#### ABOUT THE MEAL 

Saffron is a luxury spice commonly used in Persian, Indian, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern cooking. While it can be expensive, a little bit goes a long way. I tend to use Â½ teaspoon saffron for every 1 cup of rice. The floral fragrance of the saffron is brought out even more when mixed with a hot fluid, water or milk, making the rice rich and savory.
