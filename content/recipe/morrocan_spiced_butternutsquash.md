### ABOUT THE MEAL

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Butternut Squash: I use fresh butternut squash here, but you can also use frozen for convenience. Using frozen does change the texture some.   

* Vegetables: You do not have to include the onions and brussel sprouts, but I enjoy the diversity in textures. The brussels and onion also add pretty color to the dish. 

* Spices: I love how Ras El Hanout compliments the sweetness of the butternut squash. Like many spice blends, ras el hanout differs from region to region, and there is no specific combination of spices that make up the spice blend. Commonly used ingredients include cardamom, onion powder, cumin, clove, cinnamon, garlic powder, nutmeg, mace, allspice, cinnamon, ginger, coriander seed, peppercorn, sweet and hot paprika, fenugreek, and dry turmeric. For this reason, I suggest making a ras el hanout at home, so that it suits your family's taste and preferences. If you go the store-bought route, I recommend buying from Sadaf; their blend includes paprika, onion powder, coriander powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt, turmeric, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper. I tried to link theirs for you, but Amazon did not include it in their store. 

* Green Apples: I don't know about you, but I am not a fan of butternut squash texture; That's why I prefer to add green apples. They add crunch and a bit of tartness to an already sweet dish. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3uG5Mdg) 

#### Is vegetarian? Is it vegan?

* This side dish is naturally vegetarian and vegan. 

#### Can I freeze baked butternut squash?

Yes, they can; lay the leftover butternut in a single layer on a baking sheet and place them in the freezer until frozen. Then, place the squash in a freezer-safe container or bag; the butternut squash will freeze for up to 3 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it in the oven. The texture will have changed some due to the freezing process, but the flavor will still be there.
