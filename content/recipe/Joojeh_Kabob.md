Cook Time: 10 minutes 

Marinating Time: 24 hours

Cuisine: Persian 

#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Marinade: 

* 4 Chicken Breasts, boneless and skinless, cut into 2-inch pieces 
* 1 small White Onion, thinly sliced 
* 1/3 cup Lemon Juice 
* 1/8 tsp Saffron Stems, ground into a powder with a mortar and pestle 
* 1/4 tsp Salt 
* 1/4 tsp Pepper 
* 1/4 cup Olive Oil, plus more for brushing over the vegetables 

For the Kabob: 

* 3-4 small Tomatoes, whole 
* 3-4 small Red Onions, cut in half  
* 3-4 Mini Peppers, whole 
* 2-3 Serrano Peppers, whole 
* Salt and Pepper, to taste 

#### DIRECTIONS 

For the Marinade: 

1. Trim any fat from the chicken breasts and then cut them into 2-inch pieces. Put them into a large bowl
2. Next, add the onion slices, lemon juice, saffron, salt, and pepper to the bowl. Toss to coat, ensuring all chicken pieces take on the rich saffron color. Then stir in the olive oil to combine.
4. Cover the bowl and allow the chicken to marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before grilling. 

For the Kabob: 

1. Prepare the grill by removing the grate and setting it to high heat. 
2. Using narrow skewers, skewer the tomatoes, onions, peppers, and serrano. Brush them lightly with olive oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste. 
3. Next, skewer the chicken with wide skewers. 
4. Rest the skewers on the grill, about 4-5 inches from the flame or coals. If the grill is too small, be sure to grill the vegetables first. Keep them warm with aluminum foil while you grill the chicken. 
5. Place the chicken skewers on the grill. As soon as one side begins changing color, grill the other side to seal the juiciness of the chicken. Keep turning the skewers until they are golden brown on all sides. Check a piece by cutting into it with a knife. 
6. Remove the chicken and serve immediately with slices of lemon along with the vegetables and either [saffron rice](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/saffron_rice/) or Persian bread or both.  

#### ABOUT THE MEAL

After eating at a Persian restaurant for our daughter's first birthday several years ago, we attempted to make a joojeh kebab recipe that would do their dish justice. While we will never reach their level of expertise, this version of the popular dish is absolutely delicious.
