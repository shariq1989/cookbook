#### How to Make Sesame Tofu and Mushroom Stir-Fry 

#### Ingredients

* 1 package Shiitake Mushrooms, sliced 
* 8 Scallions, whites and greens separated- whites, cut in 1-inch pieces- green, thinly sliced 
* 3 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 2-5 [Arbol Chillis](https://amzn.to/3c4M7M9), dried, diced and seeds removed
* 4 tbsp [Sesame Oil](https://amzn.to/3vBPljh)
* 3 tbsp [Soy Sauce](https://amzn.to/3cSjF0U) 
* 1 tbsp [Rice Wine Vinegar](https://amzn.to/2OEvTRY)

* 1 tsp Honey 
* 1 cup Water 
* ½ tsp Flour, All Purpose 
* ¼ tsp Black Pepper, coarse ground 
* ¼ tsp Toasted Sesame Seeds   

#### Instructions 

1. Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees.
2. Prepare the tofu by patting it dry with a cloth to remove as much moisture as possible. Cut the tofu into bite-size cubes and lightly season with salt and pepper. 
3. Spread out the tofu onto the [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3BmRIbW) and cook for 15 minutes, turning the tofu pieces midway.
4. In a [skillet](https://amzn.to/3nUk88P) or [wok](https://amzn.to/2YC4Mfx), warm sesame oil over medium-high heat and add the already baked tofu to the hot pan. Fry until the pieces become golden brown. Set aside. 
5. Using the same oil (add more if needed), add the chilies, scallion whites, and garlic. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
6. Combine soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, fish sauce, honey, and water in a small bowl. Stir until the honey completely dissolves.
7. Off heat, add the ingredients from the bowl to the [pan](https://amzn.to/2YC4Mfx), and season with black pepper. 
8. Return the [pan](https://amzn.to/2YC4Mfx) to medium-high heat, and bring the mixture to a boil. Then, whisk in the flour. 
9. Add the mushrooms, stir to combine, and lower the heat. Simmer until sauce reduces halfway, about 5 minutes. 
10. Return the tofu to the pan and stir to combine.
11. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and scallion greens, and serve with jasmine rice.

### About the Meal

This savory tofu and mushroom stir-fry is the perfect vegetarian or vegan main dish and comes together in about 30 minutes. The crispy tofu absorbs the earthy mushroom and sesame flavor for a hearty and filling meal. I hope you enjoy this recipe our family loves. 

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Extra-Firm Tofu: I prefer using extra-firm tofu because it holds up well during the baking and stir-frying processes. 

* Shiitake Mushrooms: I love sliced shiitake mushrooms; they absorb other flavors so well. We often add other mushrooms to change it up, but shiitake mushrooms are tried and true. 

* Sesame: Enjoy the rich sesame flavor in two ways using sesame oil and sesame seeds. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3EAPI1e)
* A [large skillet](https://amzn.to/3nUk88P) or [wok](https://amzn.to/2YC4Mfx)
* A small bowl

#### Is sesame mushroom and tofu stir-fry vegetarian? Is it vegan?

This dish caters to both a vegetarian and vegan way of eating. Easily replace the fish sauce in the recipe with [marmite](https://amzn.to/2OXF8fQ)instead; the marmite adds umami flavor we are going for with the fish sauce. You can also substitute the honey in the recipe for agave.
