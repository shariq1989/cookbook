#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Rub: 

* 1/2 cup Brown Sugar

* 1 tbsp Black Pepper
* 1 tbsp Salt
* 1 tbsp Garlic Powder
* 1 tbsp Onion Powder
* 1 tbsp Red Chili Powder

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Remove the membrane from the ribs. 
2. Rub the meat thoroughly with the spice rub. 
3. On a rimmed baking sheet, cover the ribs with heavy aluminum foil and place in the fridge for 1 hour. 
4. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 250 degrees. 
5. Remove the ribs from the foil and place into a microwave-safe dish, microwave for 1 minute. 
6. Return the ribs to the baking sheet and re-cover with the aluminum foil. Allow the ribs to cook for 4 hours on the lowest rack. 
7. Cover the ribs in BBQ Sauce of your choice. 
8. Broil for 15 minutes on the highest rack. 

#### ABOUT THE MEAL 

These ribs come out perfectly every time and there are never leftovers. If you don't have the time to prepare the spice rub suggested in the recipe, we recommend using Montreal Seasoning.
