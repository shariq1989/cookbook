#### Can I freeze waffles?

Yes, that's actually my favorite thing about making these waffles. I often double the recipe only to freeze them, so I have access to a quick and easy breakfast the next time around. First, allow the waffles to cool completely. Then, add them to a freezer-safe bag or container. The waffles will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let them defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm them in the oven or microwave and prepare your toppings.
