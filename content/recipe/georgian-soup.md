### How to Make Georgian Chicken Soup 

#### Ingredients  

For the Chicken Broth: 

* 2½ - 3 lbs Bone-in, Skin-on Chicken 
* 1 bunch Cilantro, stems and ends reserved separately
* 1 bunch Dill, stems and ends reserved separately
* 1 Garlic Head 
* 8 cup Water 
* 1 large White Onion, quartered 
* 3 tsp Kosher Salt 
* 1 tsp Peppercorns 
* ½ tsp Coriander Seeds 
* 2 tsp Red Pepper Flakes 
* 1 Cinnamon Stick 
* 2 Bay Leaves 

For the Soup: 

* 1 stick of Butter, salted 
* 5 medium Carrots, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
* 1 large White Onion, diced 
* 1 tsp Kosher Salt  
* 1 tsp Flour 
* 1 tbsp Soy Sauce
* 6 Egg Yolks 
* ½ cup Lemon Juice, about 2 lemons
* Red Chili Flakes, to taste
* Coarse Black Pepper, to taste

#### Stove-Top Instructions 

For the Chicken Broth: 

1. Tie the stems of the cilantro and dill bundles, then trim the leaves. Reserve ¼ cup of each for garnish. 
2. Cut off and discard the top third of the garlic head, leaving the head intact. 
3. In a [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3o7zDem), add the chicken, cilantro and dill stems, garlic head, and the remaining broth ingredients. Bring soup to a boil and then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer until chicken is tender, about 45 minutes-1 hour.
4. Remove the lid and scoop up the garlic head. Set aside. 
5. Transfer the chicken to a [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3D69eBk) to cool. Shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces, discarding the skin, bones, and cartilage. You can keep the legs intact if you prefer, but remove the skin. 
6. Strain the broth into a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/32w9Q6C) and discard any solids. 
7. Using tongs, squeeze the garlic head into the broth, and whisk to combine. Set aside. 

For the Soup: 

1. In the same [pot](https://amzn.to/3o7zDem), add butter, carrots, onions, and salt. Set over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions become translucent and soften, about 10-12 minutes. 
2. Add flour and stir for 1-2 minutes to build a roux, and then add soy sauce. 
3. Add 2 cups of the reserved broth and stir until smooth. Next, add the remaining broth and bring to a simmer. 
4. In another [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/32w9Q6C), whisk the yolks together. Continue whisking the yolks while slowly adding 1 cup of the hot broth from the pot. Then, remove the pot from heat and whisk in the lemon juice, and return the mixture to the [pot](https://amzn.to/3o7zDem). Stir to combine.
5. Add the reserved chicken and any accumulated juices. Do not simmer once the eggs are in the mixture. 
6. Taste, and then season with salt, pepper, and red chili flakes.
7. To serve, garnish with fresh cilantro, dill, and more chili flakes.

### About the Soup

Who else loves a good chicken soup? Whether the onset of fall or a seasonal cold, having a go-to chicken soup is pretty necessary at this point. If I had to choose only one, this soup would be mine. Like other Georgian dishes, the addition of lemon and fresh dill create the tartness of the chikhirtma, which is balanced by the creaminess of the egg yolks.

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Chicken: For this recipe, I prefer using bone-in chicken because it makes for a great-tasting broth. You can also use any combination of boneless legs, thighs, and breasts to make your soup.  If you choose to go this route, you can use store-bought chicken stock to flavor the soup. Since you're skipping the broth-making process, I would still take a moment to allow the chicken broth to cook with the cilantro and dill stems, garlic, onions, and whole spices, so you don't lose any of the flavors. 

* Cilantro 

* Dill 

* Garlic Head 

* Onion 

* Spices: I used Kosher salt, peppercorns, coriander seeds, red pepper flakes, a cinnamon stick, and bay leaves to flavor the homemade broth for the soup. 

* Butter 

* Carrots 

* Flour 

* Soy Sauce 

* Egg Yolks: Using egg yolks thickens and flavors the soup while balancing the tartness of the other flavors like lemon and dill. 

* Lemon Juice: Lemon juice provides the right amount of acid, and lends the traditional tangy, Georgian flavor to the soup. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3o7zDem) or [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3u9c6L1)
* A [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3D69eBk)
* 2 [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/32w9Q6C)

#### How do I store the leftovers?

Leftover soup will keep in the fridge for 3-4 days in a covered container. To extend the shelf-life, you can freeze the soup to use again at another time. First, allow the dish to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. The chikhirtma will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm the soup on a stove or in the microwave, and enjoy.
