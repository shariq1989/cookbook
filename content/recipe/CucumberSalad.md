#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 tsp Kosher Salt, divided 
* 4 tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar
* 1/2 tsp Sesame Oil 
* 1/2 tsp Soy Sauce 
* 1 Cucumber, thinly sliced lengthwise
* 1/2 tbsp Toasted White Sesame Seeds

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a bowl, combine the kosher salt, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, and soy sauce. Whisk together and set aside.  
2. Thinly slice the cucumbers lengthwise, using a vegetable peeler or mandoline. You could also slice them thinly into rounds.  
3. Sprinkle the reserved kosher salt onto the cucumbers and massage it in. Let them stand, about 5 minutes. 
4. Blot the cucumbers with a towel to remove any excess moisture from the cucumbers and then add them to the sauce mixture.
