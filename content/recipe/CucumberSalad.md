Preparation Time: 10 minutes 

Cuisine: Japanese 

Adapted From: Outdoor Chef Life 

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 tsp Kosher Salt, divided 
* 4 tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar
* 1/2 tsp Sesame Oil 
* 1/2 tsp Soy Sauce 
* 6 Cocktail Cucumber, thinly sliced into rounds
* 1/2 tbsp Toasted White Sesame Seeds

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a bowl, combine the kosher salt, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, and soy sauce. Whisk together and set aside.  
2. Thinly slice the cucumbers into rounds. 
3. Sprinkle the reserved kosher salt onto the cucumbers and massage it in. Let them stand, about 5 minutes. 
4. Blot the cucumbers with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture from the cucumbers and then add them to the sauce mixture. 
5. Use a fork or slotted spoon to serve the cucumbers so that the cucumbers carry the marinade flavor, but it's not overwhelming.
6. Garnish with toasted white sesame seeds.
