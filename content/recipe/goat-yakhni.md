### How to Make Goat Yakhni 

#### Ingredients 

* 1 tbsp [Ghee](https://amzn.to/3vmpBaf)
* 1 Yellow Onion, diced 
* 3-5 Garlic Cloves, minced
* Fresh Ginger, 1-inch piece, julienne 
* 1 Thai Green Chili, slit lengthwise
* 1 Cinnamon Stick 
* 1 lb Goat, cut into 1-inch pieces, bone-in, plus extra bones if you have them 
* 4 cup Water 
* 1 tsp Salt 
* 3 [Black Cardamom](https://amzn.to/3E3UAvQ), lightly crushed 
* 2 [Green Cardamom](https://amzn.to/3o9eWyl)
* 3 Cloves 
* 1 tbsp [Cumin Seeds](https://amzn.to/3cXRhKH) 
* 1 tsp [Coriander Seeds](https://amzn.to/3o16wcb)
* 1 [Star Anise](https://amzn.to/3I4ayZ6)
* 2 Bay Leaves 

#### Instructions

1. In the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qLtTEw), warm ghee on saute mode. Next, add the onions and cook until they become translucent and soften. 
2. While the onions are cooking, add the spices, apart from salt, to the [spice infuser](https://amzn.to/38zcQ2w). Set aside. 
3. Add the garlic, ginger, green chili, and cinnamon stick to the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qLtTEw) and let it cook until aromatic. 
4. Next, add the goat and let it fry, stirring continuously, for about 1 minute. 
5. Combine the water and salt with the other ingredients and stir. 
6. Lastly, add the spice infuser to the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qLtTEw), secure the lid, and cook on manual high pressure for 1 hour with quick release. 
7. Using a [colander](https://amzn.to/3xB30Zg), pour the yakhni into a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3E5SPy0). Toss the cinnamon stick, the spices inside the spice infuser, and any ingredients left behind in the straining process. 
8. You will have tender goat pieces after making the soup; I prefer to reserve them separately to make another favorite of our family, a dish called yakhni pulao. If you decide to go that route, be sure to save 1 cup of the yakhni brothe. Do not store it in the same dish as the goat. 
9. To serve, add the broth to a bowl or a nice mug, garnish with extra ginger and cilantro, and enjoy.

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

I wasn't keen on the idea of yakhni when my mother-in-law first offered to make it for me. I was pregnant with our daughter, and had been hospitalized twice due to sickness and dehydration. I couldn't keep down food and everything made me nauseous. I finally gave in and let her make it for me, and I am forever grateful. It ended up being a meal I ate daily throughout my pregnancy. My mother-in-law would make it in large batches and freeze it for me when she would come to visit. Even now, there are few things more comforting than a steaming bowl of yakhni topped with fresh ginger and cilantro. This recipe will break down how to make an Indian bone broth, also called yakhni. It is most commonly made with goat or beef, and is also the base for another recipe on our site called yakhni pulao.

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Goat Bones: The purpose of eating yakhni is for the nutrients that come from bones, so as long as you have bones, it will be tasty. I prefer goat meat and bones because we re-purpose the goat meat to make a separate dish, called yakhni pulao. Essentially, we get two meals out of one. 

* Yakhni Masala: I make homemade yakhni masala with whole spices. I sometimes play with the blend, but this one is always tasty and includes: Black Cardamon Pods, Green Cardamon Pods, Cloves, Cumin Seeds, Coriander Seeds, Star Anise, Bay Leaves, and Salt.   

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* An [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rJtgwM)
* A [spice infuser](https://amzn.to/3lhIYN1)
* A [colander](https://amzn.to/3xB30Zg)
* A [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3E5SPy0)

#### Is yakhni keto? Is it low-carb?

Yakhni both is keto and low-carb and packed full of nutrients that can even help with the all too common keto flu. I calculated the macros to make it easier for you. 

* CARBS– 2 Net Carbs
* PROTEIN– 25g
* FAT– 8g

If you strain the onions, the net carbs drop to 1g.

#### What are the benefits of yakhni? 

Yakhni is highly nutritious and a meal all on its own. It has soothing qualities, helpful for people with colds, stomachaches, and morning sickness (like me). The meat and spices marinate to create the broth, leaving it both tasty and mineral-dense. One of the main ingredients for yakhni is goat bones, or collagen; collagen is essential for hair and nail health, as well as joint wellness.

#### Can I freeze Yakhni?

You sure can. As I mentioned, my mother-in-law often made multiple batches of yakhni soup and froze them for me before teaching me how to make it. First, allow the yakhni to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container. I prefer to freeze it in individual bags to make defrosting it easier. Yakhni can freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove or in the microwave, and enjoy.
