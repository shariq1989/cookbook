date = "2021-03-13"
description = "Mutton yakhni soup or yakni is a Pakistani and Indian-style bone broth made with fresh, whole spices and herbs. Our bone broth recipe is a beautiful combination of onion, garlic, ginger, green chilies, cinnamon, goat or mutton bones, and meat, black cardamon, green cardamon, black cloves, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, star anise, bay leaves, and salt.  We like to garnish our yakhni soup with fresh ginger, cilantro, and lemon wedges. I wasn't keen on bone broth when my mother-in-law first offered to make it for me. I was pregnant and had been hospitalized twice due to sickness and dehydration. I couldn't keep down food, and everything made me nauseous. I finally gave in and let her make it for me, and I am forever grateful. It ended up being a soup I ate daily throughout my pregnancy. My mother-in-law would make it in large batches and freeze the rest for me when she would visit. Yakhni is highly nutritious and a meal all on its own that Pakistani and Indian parents often give to adults and children who aren't feeling well. I totally get why. Yakhni has soothing qualities, helpful for those with colds, stomachaches, and morning sickness (like me). The meat and spices marinate to create the broth, leaving a tasty and mineral-dense soup for you to enjoy. The core ingredient of yakhni is bones, which are packed full of collagen; collagen is essential for hair and nails health, as well as joint wellness. Since I am referring to the health benefits of yakhni soup, I should also mention that bone broth is keto and low-carb, and packed full of nutrients to help with the all-too-common keto flu. This soup is great for you and tasty to boot. Even now, there are few things more comforting than a steaming bowl of yakhni. Like me, I hope you enjoy this yakhni soup recipe our family loves."

### How to Make Goat Yakhni 

#### Ingredients 

For the Yakhni Soup: 

* 1 tbsp [Ghee](https://amzn.to/3vmpBaf)
* 1 Yellow Onion, diced 
* 3-5 Garlic Cloves, minced
* Fresh Ginger, 1-inch piece, julienne, plus more to garnish  
* 1 Thai Green Chili, slit lengthwise
* 1 Cinnamon Stick 
* 1 lb Goat, washed and cut into 1-inch pieces, skinless and bone-in, plus extra bones if you have them 
* 4 cup Water 
* 1 tsp Kosher Salt 
* 1 lemon, thinly sliced, to garnish
* Cilantro, chopped, to garnish 

For the Yakhni Masala: 

* 3 [Black Cardamom](https://amzn.to/3E3UAvQ), lightly crushed 
* 2 [Green Cardamom](https://amzn.to/3o9eWyl)
* 3 Black Cloves 
* 1 tbsp [Cumin Seeds](https://amzn.to/3cXRhKH) 
* 1 tsp [Coriander Seeds](https://amzn.to/3o16wcb)
* 1 [Star Anise](https://amzn.to/3I4ayZ6)
* 2 Bay Leaves 

#### Instructions

1. In the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qLtTEw), warm ghee on saute mode. Next, add the onions and cook until they become translucent and soften. 
2. While the onions are cooking, add the whole spices to a [spice infuser](https://amzn.to/38zcQ2w). Set aside. 
3. Add the garlic, ginger, green chili, and cinnamon stick to the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qLtTEw) and let it cook until aromatic. 
4. Next, rinse the goat and bones before adding them to the [pot](https://amzn.to/3qLtTEw) and frying them on saute mode for about 1 minute. 
5. Add the water and salt and stir to combine. 
6. Lastly, add the spice infuser to the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qLtTEw), secure the lid, and cook on manual high pressure for 1 hour with quick release. 
7. Using a [colander](https://amzn.to/3xB30Zg), pour the yakhni into a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3E5SPy0). Toss the cinnamon stick, the spices inside the spice infuser, and any ingredients left behind in the straining process. 
8. You will have tender goat pieces after making the soup; I reserve them separately to make a favorite of our family- a meal called yakhni pulao. If you decide to go that route, reserve 1 cup of the yakhni broth along with it. Do not store the broth in the same dish as the goat. 
9. To serve, add the broth to a bowl or mug, garnish with extra ginger, cilantro, and lemon wedges. Enjoy!

### About the Soup 

Mutton yakhni soup or yakni is a Pakistani and Indian-style bone broth made with fresh, whole spices and herbs. I wasn't keen on yakhni when my mother-in-law first offered to make it for me. I was pregnant and had been hospitalized twice due to sickness and dehydration. I couldn't keep down food, and everything made me nauseous. I finally gave in and let her make it for me, and I am forever grateful. It ended up being a soup I ate daily throughout my pregnancy. My mother-in-law would make it in large batches and freeze the rest for me when she would visit. Even now, there are few things more comforting than a steaming bowl of yakhni topped with fresh ginger, cilantro, and lemon wedges. Like me, I hope you enjoy this yakhni soup recipe our family loves.

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* [Ghee](https://amzn.to/3vmpBaf)

* Yellow Onion

* Garlic Cloves

* Fresh Ginger

* Thai Green Chili

* Cinnamon Stick 

* Goat or Mutton: The purpose of yakhni is to consume the nutrients from bone-in meat. I prefer using goat with the meat and bones intact because we re-purpose the meat to make a separate dish, called yakhni pulao. Essentially, we get two meals out of one each time we make it.

* Kosher Salt 

* Lemon

* Cilantro 

* Yakhni Masala: I use a homemade yakhni masala with fresh, whole spices. I often play with the masala, but this one is always tasty and includes: black cardamon, green cardamon, black cloves, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, star anise, bay leaves, and kosher salt.   

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* An [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rJtgwM)
* A [spice infuser](https://amzn.to/3lhIYN1)
* A [colander](https://amzn.to/3xB30Zg)
* A [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3E5SPy0)

#### How can I use yakhni soup? 

* You can serve the soup as is with fresh toppings. 
* You can add some reserved yakhni to rice and make yakhni pulao. 
* You can use the bone broth as a base for soups and stews. 

#### Is yakhni keto? Is it low-carb?

Yakhni Soup is keto and low-carb and packed full of nutrients to help with the all-too-common keto flu. I calculated the macros to make it easier for you. 

* CARBS– 2 Net Carbs
* PROTEIN– 25g
* FAT– 8g

#### What are the benefits of yakhni soup? 

Yakhni is highly nutritious and a meal all on its own. It has soothing qualities, helpful for those with colds, stomachaches, and morning sickness (like me). The meat and spices marinate to create the broth, leaving a tasty and mineral-dense soup for you to enjoy. A main ingredient of yakhni is goat bones, which are packed with collagen; collagen is essential for hair and nails health, as well as joint wellness.

#### Can I freeze yakhni?

You sure can. As I mentioned, my mother-in-law often made multiple batches of yakhni soup and froze them for me. First, allow the yakhni to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. I prefer to freeze it in individual bags to make defrosting it easier. Yakhni will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat it, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove or in the microwave, prepare your fresh toppings, and enjoy.
