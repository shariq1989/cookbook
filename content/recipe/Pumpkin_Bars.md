#### ABOUT THE MEAL 

Let it be known, I am not a fan of pumpkin. Usually, I turn the other way when offered anything of the pumpkin variety. However, a few Christmases ago our sweet neighbor delivered a pumpkin sweet treat like this and I gave it a try. She got me with that cream cheese frosting. So here is a pumpkin dessert that even pumpkin-haters like myself can enjoy.
