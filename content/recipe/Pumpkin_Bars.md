### ABOUT THE DESSERT 

Let it be known- I am not a fan of pumpkin. However, two Christmases ago, our sweet neighbor in Colorado delivered a pumpkin treat similar to this one. To my surprise, I gave them a try- though she did lure me with the cream cheese frosting. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large and a small bowl 
* A [handmixer](https://amzn.to/3rZWFmo)
* A [jelly roll](https://amzn.to/3s7YJJj)
