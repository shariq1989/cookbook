* 1/2 tsp [Red Food Powder](https://amzn.to/3b6L8vF), optional
* 1 cup Plain Yogurt, full fat 
* 2 tbsp Lemon Juice, plus lemon wedges to garnish
* 1 tbsp Garlic Paste 
* 1 tbso Ginger Paste 
* 1/2 Red onion, roughly chopped

#### TANDOORI CHICKEN IN OVEN 

1. In a [blender](https://amzn.to/3GwEcFS) or [food processor](https://amzn.to/3Cs5k6e), mix the olive oil, salt, garlic powder, turmeric, cayenne powder, paprika, garam masala, red food powder, yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, and ginger paste until smooth. 
2. Make 1-2 small slits in each chicken piece, and then toss them in the tandoori chicken marinade, along with the chopped onion, until coated. Cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 6 hours, preferably 24 hours. Yes, it is a long time, but it makes it oh so good. 
3. Pre-heat the oven to 400 degrees and then set a wire rack into a rimmed baking sheet; line the chicken onto it, leaving excess marinade behind. 
4. Cook for 25-35 minutes, flipping the chicken halfway through. Check to make sure the temperature has reached 170 degrees. 
5. Let the chicken rest for about 5 minutes before serving. 
6. Garnish with [chutney](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/raita/) and serve with fresh naan, long-grained basmati rice, or a nice salad.

2. Make 1-2 small slits in each chicken piece, and then toss them in the tandoori chicken marinade, along with the chopped onion, until coated. Cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 6 hours, preferably 24 hours. Yes, it is a long time, but it makes it oh so good.

4. Turn off the rightmost burner, but maintain a grill temperature of 350 degrees.

7. Move the chicken to the cool side of the grill, the rightmost burner you turned off, and cook them for 25 minutes.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken: I prefer to use drumsticks and thighs. 

* Tandoori Chicken Masala: I love using the marinade in this recipe, but you can use a store-bought [tandoori masala](https://amzn.to/3BrMAT0) if you prefer; be sure to add yogurt, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic paste, ginger paste, and onion to flavor the marinade. 

* Yogurt and Lemon: Both tenderize the meat before cooking. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [blender](https://amzn.to/3GwEcFS) or [food processor](https://amzn.to/3Cs5k6e)
* A large bowl

#### What to serve with tandoori chicken:

####  Can I freeze drumsticks?

Yes. Allow the chicken to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. The chicken will freeze for up to 4 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm the chicken in the oven or microwave.
