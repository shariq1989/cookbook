### ABOUT THE MEAL 

We love get-togethers with family and friends; these tandoori drumsticks are the perfect addition to any cookout, picnic, or backyard gathering.

Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with Desi food. If you asked me the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry, I couldn’t have told you, so learning how to cook Indian food is near and dear to my heart. It’s been an honor to study Desi cooking under my talented mother-in-law. She prepares food off-script; you have to watch her closely as she buzzes through the kitchen, or you miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build upon flavors and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by what I have learned cooking alongside her.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken: I prefer drumsticks since they are usually the first to go when we make this dish. However, you can use breast or thighs as well. Be sure to adjust the cooking time accordingly. If using chicken breast, I recommend cutting the breast in half. – The safe cooking temperature for chicken is 160 degrees.

* Tandoori Masala: I love using spice blend in this recipe, but you can also use a store-bought tandoori masala if you prefer. 

* Yogurt and Lemon: Both tenderize the meat before cooking. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large bowl 
* 1-2 rimmed bakings sheets 
* A wire rack 

####  Can I freeze the drumsticks?

Yes, first allow the drumsticks to cool completely and then add them to a freezer-safe container. Chicken drumsticks will freeze for up to 4months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it in the oven or the microwave.
