### About the Ramen Noodles 

A hot steaming bowl of Korean ramen noodles will always be something I crave. It was certainly something I missed when I began considering my carbs more carefully. Thankfully with this recipe, Korean ramen is something you can still enjoy. 

#### What ingredients are needed to make this dish?

* Eggs: Poached eggs are a perfect addition to this already tasty ramen. You could also use hard or soft-boiled eggs if you prefer. 

* Distilled White Vinegar 

* [Beef Better Than Bouillion](https://amzn.to/3F7a5nd): I use Better Than Bouillion in place of beef stock for this recipe. It's flavorful, easy, and something I always keep in my pantry. 

* Soy Sauce: Made of fermented soybeans, soy sauce lends saltiness and umami to the dish. For a gluten-free option, use [Tamari](https://amzn.to/32eu8RU). For a soy-free option, [coconut amino acid](https://amzn.to/3p2PISt) is a great alternative. 

* [Sesame Oil](https://amzn.to/3mh5jvX): Sesame oil adds texture and nuttiness to the ramen. 

* Kimchi: Guess what? Kimchi is not just a side dish in banchan; it is often the main ingredient for many recipes. When using kimchi for soups or stew, be sure that it is fermented and sour. I read somewhere that the older the kimchi, the better.

* [Gochujang](https://amzn.to/3skzFl0) or Korean Red Pepper Paste: This is a staple in Korean cooking and refers to a paste comprised of red chili flakes, sticky rice, fermented soybean paste, and salt.

* [Gochugaru](https://amzn.to/3shgJno) or Korean Red Pepper Powder: This spice is another staple of Korean cuisine made of deseeded chili peppers.

* Garlic: I suggest using four cloves, but don't my recipe tell you how much garlic to add- go for it.

* [Ginger Paste](https://amzn.to/33JERox)

* [Shiitake Mushrooms](https://amzn.to/3q9PS9U): Use fresh or dried shitake mushrooms, whichever you prefer. I suggest using dried mushrooms in this recipe because as they re-hydrate in the water, mushrooms add a nuttiness to the broth.

* Silken Tofu

* [Shirataki Noodles](https://amzn.to/3mhTV33): I know what you might be thinking- what are shirataki noodles and where can I find them? Invented in Japan, shirataki noodles are made of konjac yam. I have been able to find them in my local grocery stores recently. If not, check your local Asian markets or health food stores. These noodles have a gelatinous texture, and while they have no taste of their own, they absorb the flavors in the dish. 

* Scallions: Scallions or green onions add a nice peppery finish to the ramen. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [sieve](https://amzn.to/3EaOHMq) 
* A [ramekin](https://amzn.to/33FrBRG)
* A [saucepan](https://amzn.to/3mbpQly) 
* A whisk 

#### Cooking tips for using shirataki noodles: 

1. Choose the Right Brand: I was not a fan of shirataki noodles for a long time, even if they made some of my favorite meals possible on a low-carb diet. It was something about the texture and smell I couldn't get over. What I have come to find out is that brand matters. House Foods is by far the best-tasting brand out there, and they have a variety of noodles, making them versatile. For this recipe, I suggest using the [angel hair](https://amzn.to/3mhTV33) shirataki noodles as they resemble ramen most accurately.  

2. Prepare your Noodles: Please, please, please, do not add the noodles straight into your ramen! For best results, drain the liquid from the packaging. Next, soak them in water for 15-10 minutes, then rinse, rinse, rinse. Now you're ready to add them to your dish.
