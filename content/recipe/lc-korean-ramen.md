#### Stove-Top Instructions

1. In a [saucepan](https://amzn.to/3oKaYN7), add water, fish sauce, soy sauce, gochujang, and Better than Bouillon. If you're adding dried mushrooms to the dish, you can also add them during this step. Cover and cook for 10-15 minutes over medium heat, adjusting the temperature to maintain a gentle simmer.

3. In a [Dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3lC91Pi) or [earthenware pot](https://amzn.to/3soWXDL), saute the kimchi until it becomes soft. Set it aside. 
4. In the same [pot]((https://amzn.to/3lC91Pi)), warm 1 tablespoon sesame oil over medium heat. Then add onion, garlic, and scallion whites. Cook until onions become translucent and soften for about 8 minutes. 
5. Add the reserved stock. Cover and cook for 5-7 minutes over medium heat. Then, open and stir in the reserved kimchi.

### About the Jjigae

Kimchi jjigae, kimchi chigae, kimchi stew, or kimchi soup, whatever name you give it, is quickly becoming a favorite in our home. Primarily because of the ingredients and how easy it is to make. Our version of kimchi tofu soup is rich and flavorful and can be made on the stovetop or in an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3DpZGSo).

#### What are the kimchi jjigae ingredients?

* [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/3uYz9IW) or [Marmite](https://amzn.to/3s7odt0)

* [Beef](https://amzn.to/3oM8L3W) or [Vegetable](https://amzn.to/3Atsuay) Better than Bouillon 

* Soy Sauce 

* [Gochujang](https://amzn.to/2NHrNZ3) or Korean Red Pepper Paste: This is a staple in Korean cooking and refers to a paste comprised of red chili flakes, sticky rice, fermented soybean paste, and salt. 

* [Shitake Mushrooms](https://amzn.to/3I0K0YN): Use fresh or dried shitake mushrooms, whichever you prefer. I suggest using dried mushrooms in this recipe because as they re-hydrate in the water, mushrooms add a nuttiness to the broth. 

* Onion

* Garlic

* Scallions or green onions: I use the white parts of the scallion to flavor the broth and garnish with the peppery greens of the onion. 

* [Sesame Oil](https://amzn.to/3b72o2v)

* Kimchi: Guess what? Kimchi is not just a side dish in banchan; it is often the main ingredient for many recipes. When using kimchi for stew, be sure that it is fermented and sour. I read somewhere that the older the kimchi, the better; I discovered this is true in my cooking as well. 

* Extra-Firm Tofu: Sundubo (soondubu) or soft tofu is favored in traditional Korean cooking, especially for soups and stews. However, my family enjoys large, rectangular slices of extra firm tofu in our jjigae since that is what we usually have at home. 

* Kosher Salt

* [Gochugaru](https://amzn.to/2P1lLmx) or Korean Red Pepper Powder: This spice is another staple of Korean cuisine made of deseeded chili peppers. 

* Black Pepper

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [saucepan](https://amzn.to/3oKaYN7)
* A small bowl 
* A [Dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3lC91Pi), [earthenware pot](https://amzn.to/3soWXDL), or [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3DpZGSo)

#### How do you create the broth for kimchi jjigae? 

A more [traditional Korean broth](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/kimchi-jjigae) includes dried anchovy, kelp, and daikon radish, all of which create a delicious base for kimchi stew. Since these ingredients can be hard to find, I use staples from my pantry instead. Note: If you prefer more of the kimchi flavor in your jjigae, consider adding 1-2 tablespoons of the kimchi brine to flavor your broth as well. 

#### Kimchi jjigae has a sour touch to it. Can I sweeten the dish to balance the flavor? 

* Add a pinch of sugar to the broth 
* Stir in 1 teaspoon of Hoisin sauce. 

#### Is kimchi jjigae vegetarian? Is it vegan?

To make this kimchi stew recipe vegetarian and vegan-friendly, instead of fish sauce, use [Marmite](https://amzn.to/3s7odt0) for the broth. Also, be sure to use [Vegetable Better than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/3f8LK6e). 

#### Can I freeze kimchi soup? 

You sure can. Before freezing, remove the tofu from the dish. It doesn't reheat well once frozen. Then, add the rest of the stew to a freezer-safe container or bag. The kimchi stew will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stovetop, add some fresh tofu to cook along with it, and enjoy!
