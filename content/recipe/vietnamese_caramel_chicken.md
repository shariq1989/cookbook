### ABOUT THE MEAL

You will love this one pan, Vietnamese-inspired chicken. It is sticky sweet and packs a bit of heat brought on by the addition of fresh chillies. While cooking, it will look like plain ol' chicken right up until the last few minutes of cooking when it caramelizes right before your eyes, turning a perfect golden brown. I top ours with fresh cilantro, thinly sliced chillies, and a bit of lime zest

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken Thighs: I use boneless, skinless chicken thighs because they nestle into the pan and caramelize well alongside the shallots. 

* Shallots: I enjoy the sweetness shallots bring; they also pair well with the sugar and coconut water to bring about caramelization.

* Fresh Ginger: This spiced root is another staple in our home. I use it to balance the sweetness of the chicken. 

* [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/33GYOJj): You may decide to skip this ingredient because it's unfamiliar, don't. Fish sauce is an ingredient we always have in our home, and it is used frequently in Vietnamese cuisine. [Red Boat](https://amzn.to/3AO5rJ4) fish sauce is our favored brand and won't give off a fishy aroma as other brands do. 

* Coconut Water 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?
