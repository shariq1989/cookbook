### ABOUT THE MEAL

This Vietnamese-style caramel chicken is both sticky and sweet. You will love the highly flavorful chicken thighs and caramelized shallots. I top mine with chili's, fresh cilantro, and a bit of lime zest.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken Thighs: I used boneless and skinless chicken thighs. I have also tried bone-in, but I prefer boneless as I found it easier to eat along with the caramelized shallots. 

* Shallots 

* Fresh Ginger

* [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/33GYOJj): You might be tempted to skip this ingredient because it's unfamiliar, don't. Fish sauce is a staple in our home and is commonly used in Vietnamese cuisine. Red Boat fish sauce is our favored brand. 

* Coconut Water
