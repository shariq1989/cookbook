### ABOUT THE MEAL

You and your family will go crazy for this Vietnamese-style caramel chicken recipe. This chicken is sticky and sweet and packs a bit of heat brought on by the chilis. While cooking, this will look like a plain old chicken dish right up until the last few minutes of cooking when it caramelizes before your eyes and turns a perfect golden brown. I top ours with fresh cilantro, thinly sliced chilis, and a bit of lime zest.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken Thighs: I use boneless, skinless chicken thighs because they nestle into the pan and caramelize well alongside the shallots. 

* Shallots: I enjoy the sweetness shallots lend to any dish; they also pair well with the sugar and coconut to bring on caramelization.

* Fresh Ginger: This spiced root is another staple in our home. I use it to balance the sweetness of the chicken.

* [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/33GYOJj): You may decide to skip this ingredient because it's unfamiliar, don't. Fish sauce is an ingredient we always have in our home, and it is used frequently in Vietnamese cuisine. Red Boat fish sauce is our favored brand. 

* Coconut Water 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [saute pan](https://amzn.to/2Rj6uic) or [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3cr9VdW)
