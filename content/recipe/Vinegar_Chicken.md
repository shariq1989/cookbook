Servings: 4-6 <!--more-->

Cook Time: 10 minutes

Cuisine: Mediterranean

Adapted from: New York Times, Alison Roman 

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 3 lbs Chicken Thighs, bone-in, skin-on
* 1 1/2 tsp Turmeric, ground 
* 6 tbsp Olive Oil, divided
* Kosher Salt and Pepper, to taste 
* ½ cup White Wine Vinegar 
* 1½ cup Green Olives, crushed 
* 2-4 Garlic Cloves, minced 
* 1 tbsp Fresh Parsley, chopped 

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. 
2. Place chicken into a bag with olive oil and turmeric and mix well. 
3. In a prepared baking dish, add the chicken and season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper. 
4. Place the chicken into the dish skin-side up, then pour vinegar over and around the chicken and place it in the oven. Bake without flipping for 25-35 minutes. 
5. In a small bowl, combine the crushed olives, garlic, parsley, and the remaining olive oil (3 tbsp), as well as 2 tbsp of water.
6. Once the chicken is cooked, remove the baking dish and transfer the chicken thighs to a serving tray, leaving behind the juices. 
7. Pour the olive mixture into the baking dish. Using a wooden spoon, gently scrape up the bits of chicken left behind, letting the olive oil mixture mingle with the rendered fat. When mixed well, pour the dressing over the chicken to serve.  

#### ABOUT THE MEAL

This recipe is inspired by Alison Roman’s Vinegar Chicken with Crushed Olive Dressing. Her recipe was so bright and flavorful that I wanted to create a version that worked for our family. Eat this chicken with or without the dressing, though we highly recommend the dressing. Either way, we know you will leave the table with a smile on your face.
