### About the Meal 

Keema, qeema, or kheema, depending on who you ask, is a Pakistani and Indian dish made of minced meat, onions, garlic, tomatoes, spices, and herbs. Keema usually refers to ground beef, lamb, or chicken, cooked with a combination of peas, potatoes, cashews, methi leaves, ginger, garlic, chilies, and onions. While keema may not appeal to the masses the way other Indian and Pakistani dishes do, it is a familiar comfort food our family loves.

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal? 

* [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW) 

* Ground Beef: In Urdu, "keema" means minced. As such, take the time to break up the meat. You can do this using a spatula, but I highly recommend using a [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/2OoDZhv). Plus, they are pretty satisfying to use.'

* Red or Yukon Gold Potatoes

* Onion 

* Ginger 

* Thai Green Chilies 

* Roma Tomato 

* Keema Masala: I am normally one to choose homemade masala over anything else, but when it comes to keema I often use [Laziza Keema Masala](https://amzn.to/3ESn2kQ) simply out of convience and because it's really tasty. If you're in a pinch, make keema masala at home using this [recipe](keema-masala). 

* Cilantro 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [heavy-bottomed pan](https://amzn.to/3EXs3ZG)
* A [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/2OoDZhv)

#### How can I make keema vegetarian? Can I make keema vegan?

While this recipe isn't vegetarian or vegan in origin, you can follow the same instructions and use a protein source like, Ultimate Beefless Ground from Gardein. Use the beefless ground in place of the meat in this recipe. You can also use a mixture of vegetables like cauliflower and broccoli. To make the recipe vegan, you will also need to also replace the ghee. I suggest using [grapeseed oil](https://amzn.to/3p7Bz5n).

#### Are there other variations of keema?

* Beef Keema 
* Aloo Keema 
* Aloo Matar Keema
* Mutton Keema Aloo 
* Chicken Aloo Keema 

#### Can I freeze ground keema?

You sure can. First, allow the qeema to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. To prevent freezer burn, layer plastic wrap over the container before securing the lid. Keema will freeze for up to 2 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your sides.
