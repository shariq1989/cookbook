### About the Meal 

Keema or qeema is a Pakistani and Indian dish made of minced meat, onions, garlic, tomatoes, spices, and herbs. Keema usually refers to ground beef, lamb, or chicken, cooked with a combination of peas, potatoes, cashew, methi leaves, ginger, garlic, chillies, and onions. While keema doesn't have the appeal of other Indian or Pakistani dishes, it is a familiar comfort food our family loves.

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal? 

* [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW) 

* Ground Beef: In Urdu, the word "qeema" means minced. In this case, we are making beef qeema or minced beef. As such, be sure to take the time to break up the meat. You can do this with a spatula, but I highly recommend using a [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/2OoDZhv), plus they are really satisfying to use.

* Red or Yukon Gold Potatoes

* Onion 

* Ginger 

* Thai Green Chillies 

* Roma Tomato 

* [Laziza Keema Masala](https://amzn.to/3b4Y4B0): I am usually a fan of homemade masala, but keema is a perfect easy weeknight meal, so it's all about ease of execution. 

* Cilantro 

* Serrano Chillies 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [heavy-bottomed pan](https://amzn.to/3EXs3ZG)
* A [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/2OoDZhv)

#### How can I make keema vegetarian? Can I make keema vegan?

While this recipe isn't vegetarian or vegan, you can follow the same instructions and use a protein source like, Ultimate Beefless Ground from Gardein. Use beefless ground in place of the meat in this recipe. You can also use a mixture of vegetables like cauliflower and broccoli. To make the recipe vegan, you will also need to also replace the ghee. I suggest using [grapeseed oil](https://amzn.to/3p7Bz5n).

#### Are there other variations of keema?

* Beef Keema 
* Aloo Keema 
* Aloo Matar Keema
* Mutton Keema Aloo 
* Chicken Aloo Keema 

#### Can I freeze ground keema?

You sure can. First, allow the qeema to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. To prevent freezer burn, layer plastic wrap over the container before securing the lid. Keema will freeze for up to 2 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your sides.
