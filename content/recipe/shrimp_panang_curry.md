Preparation Time: 15 minutes 

Cooking Time: 20 minutes 

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 2 lbs Shrimp, large 
* 1 -4 oz [Panang Curry Paste](https://amzn.to/3wLObSf), whole can for spicy, 1/2 can for mild
* 1 tbsp Coconut Oil
* 1 medium Yellow Onion, roughly chopped
* 1 Red Bell Pepper, roughly chopped 
* 3 Garlic Cloves, minced

* 1 tbsp Fish Sauce
* Thai Basil, for garnish

#### INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a large bowl, defrost the shrimp. De-vein and remove the tails. Set aside. 
2. In a [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/2UeXCLz) or a heavy-bottomed pan like a [wok](https://amzn.to/3cQualy), warm the Panang curry paste and coconut oil until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
3. Add the onions, peppers, and garlic. Cook over medium heat until they become translucent and soften.

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

This Panang curry recipe is the perfect quick and easy weeknight meal. The flavor is creamy, tangy, and sweet, and it is excellent alongside some perfectly cooked rice. This recipe is completely customizable and can easily fit a vegetarian or vegan diet with a few omissions.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Shrimp: I used large shrimp for this recipe, but you could also use extra-large or colossal shrimp if you want something more filling. 

* Curry Paste: When it comes to Thai curry paste, we have tried them all; [Maestra's](https://amzn.to/35DP0AQ) flavor is by far the best. It is also one of the few Thai curry pastes that are vegetarian and vegan friendly, so that is a bonus. [Mae Ploy](https://amzn.to/3gH85bv) is also pretty tasty. 

* Coconut Milk: Coconut milk is a staple in Thai cooking, but be sure to use [full-fat coconut milk](https://amzn.to/3hRQ6OY). You may want to do otherwise, but don't. The richness from the fat completely changes the flavor and texture of the curry in the best way. 

* Fish Sauce: Count on the fish sauce to bring depth and extra flavor to the dish. 

* Vegetables: I use red bell pepper, mushrooms, and garlic in this curry. You can use other vegetables of your choice, including zucchini, bok choy, bean sprouts, snow peas, spinach, bamboo shoots, or carrots.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large bowl
* A [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/2UeXCLz) or heavy-bottomed pan like a [wok]((https://amzn.to/3cQualy)

5. Reduce the heat to a light simmer and add the mushrooms, Keffir lime leaves, and the remaining coconut milk. The curry should thicken, and the vegetables will reach a crisp-tenderness, about 5 minutes. If the curry does not thicken, add 2 tbsp cold water and stir to mix.
