Preparation Time: 30 minutes 

Cooking Time: 30 minutes 


#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 1/2 lb Jumbo Shrimp 
* 3 tbsp Coconut Oil, divided 
* 1 small White Onion 
* 1 -4 oz Panang Curry Paste, the whole can for spicy, 1/2 can for mild
* 1/2 Red Bell Pepper, thinly sliced
* 1/2 Orange Bell Pepper, thinly sliced
* 3 Garlic Cloves, julienne 
* 1 small Zucchini, thinly sliced, julienne 
* 1 1/2 can Full-Fat Coconut Milk, plus more if you prefer less spicy
* 2 tbsp Fish Sauce
* Thai Basil, for garnish

#### INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a large bowl, defrost the shrimp. De-vein and remove the tails. Set aside. 
2. In a dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pan, warm 1 tbsp coconut oil on medium-low heat. Add the onions and cook until they become translucent and soften. 
3. While waiting on the onions to cook, add the remaining coconut oil to a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp in a single layer and cook until the edges turn pink about 1-2 minutes.
4. Use tongs to flip each shrimp and cook the other side for 30 seconds. Then, transfer the shrimp to a plate and set aside. 
5. Add the Panang curry paste to the pan with the onions. Warm until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
6. Next, add the bell peppers, garlic, and zucchini, saute for another minute.
7. Stir in half of the coconut milk and bring the curry to a boil.
8. Reduce the heat to a light simmer and add the remaining coconut milk and fish sauce. Allow the mixture to cook for 10 minutes. The curry should thicken, and the vegetables will reach a crisp-tenderness. If the curry does not thicken, add 2 tbsp cold water and stir to mix.
9. Add the reserved shrimp to the dish and stir to combine. Allow the shrimp to simmer with the rest of the curry for 1-2 minutes. 
10. Remove from heat and garnish with Thai basil leaves and serve with jasmine rice or coconut-cilantro cauliflower rice.

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Shrimp: I use jumbo or colossal when shrimp is the main ingredient. 

* Curry Paste: We have tried them all; Maestra's flavor is by far the best. 

* Coconut Milk: Coconut milk is such is such a rich ingredient used in Thai cooking. One thing to be aware of is using full-fat coconut milk. You make be tempted to do otherwise, but I am telling you that it completely changes the flavor and texture of the curry. 

* Umami: Count on the fish sauce to bring extra flavor and depth to the dish. 

* Vegetables: I use red and orange bell peppers, garlic, and zucchini for this curry.
