#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Paste:

* 1/2 cup Full-Fat Yogurt 
* 2 tbsp Lemon Juice
* 2 tsp [Garam Masala](https://amzn.to/3u0tvEX) 
* 1 tbsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC)
* 1/2 tsp Turmeric
* 2 tsp Kosher Salt 
* 1 tbsp Laziza [Karahi Masala](https://amzn.to/2MYzcmx)
* 2 tbsp Garlic and Ginger Paste 
* 1/4 cup Cilantro, chopped, plus more for garnish
* 2 lb Chicken Thighs and Legs, bone-in and skinless 

For the Biryani: 

* 3 tbsp [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW) 
* 2 Red Onion, thinly sliced, divided
* 2 Bay Leaves
* 1 tbsp Cumin Seeds
* 5 Green Cardomom Pods
* 1 Star Anise
* 2 tsp Kosher Salt 
* 3 cup Long-Grain Basmati Rice, pre-soaked and divided. 
* Optional: 2-3 Thai Green Chilis, to serve 

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Mix the ingredients for the paste in a large bowl. Stir in the chicken and coat evenly. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. 
2. Wash the rice and soak it in water for 20 minutes. 
3. Warm the ghee (2 tbsp) in an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) using saute mode. Add the onion and cook until the onions brown and caramelize. Remove half of the onion and set aside for garnish. Then add the cumin seeds, cardamom pods, and star anise, cook for 30 seconds. 
4. Add the chicken and all of the remaining paste to the Instant Pot. Allow the mixture to fry for 3 minutes. 
5. Press "Cancel" on the Instant Pot and add the remaining ghee, bay leaves, and Thai chilis if you're using.
6. Secure the lid and cook on manual high pressure for 4 minutes with a quick release. 
7. Drain the rice and add 1 cup to a rice cooker to cook separately. Add the remaining 2 cups of rice, salt, and 2 cups of water to the Instant Pot. Secure the lid and cook on manual high pressure for 8 minutes with a quick release (this cooking time is for high elevation. You can reduce the heat for lower elevations). 
8. To serve, set out a large serving bowl or plate and layer the biryani mixture from the instant pot on the bottom, followed by a layer of the plain rice from the rice cooker (you can add rice coloring to this for texture and brightness if you choose). Repeat until the ingredients are gone. 
9. Garnish the dish with reserved fried onion and cilantro. Serve with [raita](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/raita/) and enjoy. 

#### ABOUT THE MEAL

If you are craving biryani, but not the time commitment, try this quick and easy Instant Pot biryani. It has all the flavor and brightness of the popular dish, but this recipe cuts the cooking time in half.  

Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with Desi food. If you asked back then if I knew the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry, I would not have been able to tell you, so learning how to cook Indian food is near and dear to my heart. It's been an honor to study Desi cooking under my talented mother-in-law. She prepares food off-script; you have to watch her closely as she buzzes through the kitchen, or you miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build upon flavors and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by what I have learned cooking alongside her.

#### Where does biryani originate? 

The word “biryani” is derived from the Persian word, “Biran,” which means “fried before cooking,” as such, many historians believe the flavorful rice dish was born out of Persia. So how did this popular dish arrive in India? Biryani was introduced to Northern India by the Mughals- a group also credited for bringing pilau and kebabs.

Like many well-known Indian dishes, biryani varies from region to region. Interestingly, this dish has a unique preparation in almost every area across the subcontinent. 

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Long-Grained Basmati Rice: Basmati rice is the star ingredient for any biryani, but how do you choose the right one? I recommend using [Royal Chef Secret Basmati Rice](https://amzn.to/3tbFMW20 , [Royal Authentic Basmati Rice](https://amzn.to/3cuai6I) , or [Daawat Traditional Basmati Rice](https://amzn.to/2PSJxRL). 

* Biryani Masala: I chose to make a quick and easy biryani masala using a combination of Kashmiri chili powder, garam masala, turmeric, salt, and Laziza Karahi Masala. You can also use a pre-made biryani masala like Shan Biryani Masala to make the recipe even more manageable. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large bowl 
* A set of measuring spoons
* An [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rJDIEg) 
* A [rice cooker](https://amzn.to/2OJpyED)

#### Can I make chicken biryani vegetarian? Can I make chicken biryani vegan? 

I love biryani because the options for protein are endless. Some of the more common biryanis include boiled eggs, mixed vegetables, or a mixture of the two. If making a mixed vegetable biryani, I suggest using a combination of green beans, cauliflower, carrots, and peas. To make the biryani vegan, you will want to replace the yogurt and the ghee with something more vegan-friendly. I suggest using coconut-based yogurt and vegan butter instead. 

### Can I make chicken biryani non-dairy? 

Yogurt breaks down and tenderizes the meat, so you could directly substitute it with a coconut-based yogurt. Using tomatoes in place of the yogurt could also achieve the same effect. 

#### Why do I separate the rice in this recipe? 

The rice at the bottom can end up a bit sticky because of cooking in the Instant Pot. I counteract that by reserving a portion of rice that is both light and fluffy to mix with it. If you're in a hurry, there's no need to separate the rice. Instead, add all of the rice and three cups of water to the Instant Pot before cooking. 

#### Can I freeze biryani?

Yes, allow the dish to cool completely, and then add it to a gallon Ziploc bag. The biryani will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm up a single serving in the microwave or add it all to a pan for a quick and easy meal the whole family will enjoy.
