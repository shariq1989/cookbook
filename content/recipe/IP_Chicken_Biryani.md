Servings: 8-10 <!--more-->

#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Paste:

* 1/2 cup Full-Fat Yogurt 
* 2 tbsp Lemon Juice
* 2 tsp [Garam Masala](https://amzn.to/3u0tvEX) 
* 1 tbsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC)
* 1/2 tsp Turmeric
* 2 tsp Kosher Salt 
* 1 tbsp Laziza [Karahi Masala](https://amzn.to/2MYzcmx)
* 2 tbsp Garlic and Ginger Paste 
* 1/4 cup Cilantro, chopped, plus more for garnish
* 2 lb Chicken Thighs and Legs, bone-in and skinless 

For the Biryani: 

* 3 tbsp [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW) 
* 2 Purple Onion, thinly sliced, divided
* 2 Bay Leaves
* 1 tbsp Cumin Seeds
* 5 Green Cardomom Pods
* 1 Star Anise
* 2 tsp Kosher Salt 
* 3 cup Long-Grain Basmati Rice, pre-soaked and divided. 
* Optional: 2-3 Thai Green Chilis
* Lime wedges for garnish

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a large bowl, mix the ingredients for the paste. Stir in the chicken, coat evenly, and then refrigerate, 30 minutes. 
2. Wash and soak the rice in water and set aside, 20 minutes. 
3. Warm the ghee (2 tbsp) in an Instant Pot using saute mode. Add the onion, stirring frequently, until the onions brown (not burn or charr). Remove half the onion and set aside for garnish. Then add the cumin seeds, cardomom pods, and star anise, cook for 30 seconds. 
4. Add the chicken and all of the remaining paste to the Instant Pot. Allow the mixture to fry for 3 minutes. 
5. Press "Cancel" on the Instant Pot and add the remaining ghee, bay leaves, and Thai chilis, if using.
6. Secure the lid and cook on high pressure for 4 minutes with a quick release. 
7. Drain the rice and add 1 cup to a rice cooker and cook separately. Add the remaining 2 cups of rice, salt, and 2 cups of water to the Instant Pot. Secure the lid and cook on high pressure for 8 minutes with a quick release (this cooking time is for high elevation. You can reduce the heat for lower elevations). 
8. To serve, set out a large serving bowl or plate and layer the biryani mixture from the instant pot on the bottom, followed by a layer of the plain rice from the rice cooker (you can add rice coloring to this for texture and brightness if you choose). Repeat until ingredients are gone. 
9. Garnish the dish with the reserved fried onion, cilantro, and lime wedges. Serve with [raita](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/raita/) and enjoy. 


#### THE STORY BEHIND THE MEAL

Craving biryani, but don't have all day to make it? Reach for this quick and easy biryani recipe. You still get all the flavor and brightness of this popular dish, but you cut the cook time in half. 

Quick Note About the Recipe- If you're in a hurry, you don't need to seperate the rice into a rice cooker. This is just a personal preference for our family. If you wanted to combine all of the rice into the Instant Pot, do step #7, but add all of the rice, plus three cups of water to the Instant Pot before cooking. Here is why I like to reserve some rice seperatelY: Because this recipe is made in an Instant Pot, the rice at the bottom can end up a bit mushy so I like to counteract that by reserving rice that is light and fluffy because that is what Shariq grew up with and tends to appreciate more.
