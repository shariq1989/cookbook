### ABOUT THE MEAL 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken: I used a whole butterflied chicken for this recipe because, in my opinion, that is the tastiest and most effective way to make a chicken. You can also use the rub and recipe to make chicken thighs, legs, or a combination of the two. I wouldn't recommend using chicken breast because they are more likely to come out dry if cooked alone. 
– The safe cooking temperature for chicken is 170 degrees.

* Spices: I like to use cumin, paprika, salt, and black pepper. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* 2 small bowls
* A [food processor](https://amzn.to/3eVyrod) or blender
* A [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/339IQqI)
* A [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3bE8h90)
* A [food thermometer](https://amzn.to/2RnEB8c)

#### Is Peruvian chicken keto? Is it low-carb?

Yes, it is and I even calculated the macros for you. 

* CARBS – 2 Net Carbs 
* PROTEIN – 27g
* FAT – 10g

To finish your low carb meal, I recommend serving this Peruvian chicken with coconut cauliflower rice and a side of serrano crema.
