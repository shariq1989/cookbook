### ABOUT THE MEAL 

This Peruvian chicken recipe is butterflied and roasted whole in the oven. We serve our chicken with a delicious serrano crema. This recipe can also be replicated using chicken thighs and legs as well. I hope you enjoy this meal our family loves.

#### What ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken: I used a whole, butterflied, or spatchcocked chicken for this recipe because, in my opinion, that is the tastiest and most effective way to make a chicken. Spatchcocking a chicken means cutting the backbone out of the chicken and flattening it; this allows the chicken to roast more evenly all over. You can also use the same rub and recipe to make chicken thighs, legs, or a combination of the two. I wouldn't recommend using chicken breast because they are more likely to come out dry if cooked alone. Reminder, the safe cooking temperature for chicken is 165 degrees.

* Spices: I use a tasty combination of cumin, paprika, salt, and black pepper. 
 
* Garlic

* Distilled White Vinegar 

* Olive Oil 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3bE8h90)

* A [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/339IQqI)

* A small bowl

* A [food thermometer](https://amzn.to/2RnEB8c)

#### Is Peruvian chicken keto? Is it low-carb?

Yes, it is. I even calculated the macros to make it easy for you. The serving size for these macros is 5 ounces of chicken. 

* CARBS – 2 Net Carbs 
* PROTEIN – 27g
* FAT – 10g

To finish your low-carb meal, I recommend serving this Peruvian chicken with cauliflower rice and a side of [serrano crema](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/serrano_crema/).
