### ABOUT THE MEAL

Kimchi jjigae or kimchi stew is quickly becoming a favorite in our home, mainly because of the flexible ingredients and how easy it is to make. I still need to get my hands on one of those cute [earthenware pots](https://amzn.to/3soWXDL) this stew is traditionally prepared and served within. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Broth: A more traditional Korean broth includes dried anchovy and seaweed, both of which make for a delicious broth. Since these ingredients can be hard to come by, I chose to use staples I usually have in my pantry for the broth instead. If you want more kimchi flavor in your jjigae, consider adding 1-2 tbsp of the kimchi juice to flavor the broth.  

* Tofu: I like using large slices of tofu for this dish.  While traditional kimchi jjigae includes meat and tofu, I stick to tofu in my recipe. Occasionally, I will add shiitake mushrooms to change things up a bit. 

* Kimchi: Kimchi is not just a side dish in Korean cuisine; it is the main ingredient of many recipes. From what I hear, the best kimchi jjigae is the result of using kimchi that has been in your refrigerator for quite a while. 

* Korean Spices: Gochugaru and Gochochang flavor the stew with traditional Korean spice. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

#### Can I freeze the kimchi jjigae? 

You sure can, but before freezing, remove the tofu from the dish. It doesn't reheat well. Then add the rest of the stew to a freezer-safe container. The kimchi stew will freeze for up to 3 months.
