### HOW TO MAKE KOREAN KIMCHI JJIGAE 

#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Broth: 

* 3-4 cups Water
* 2 tbsp [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/3uYz9IW)
* 1 tbsp [Beef](https://amzn.to/3oM8L3W) or [Vegetable](https://amzn.to/3Atsuay) Better than Bouillion 
* 1/2 tsp Soy Sauce 
* 1 tsp [Gochochang](https://amzn.to/2NHrNZ3)

For the Jjigae: 

* 1 small White Onion, coarsely chopped
* 3 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 8 Scallions, whites, and greens separated- whites, cut in 1-inch pieces- greens, thinly sliced
* 1 tbsp [Sesame Oil](https://amzn.to/3b72o2v), plus 2 tsp for the paste
* 1/2 cup Kimchi
* 1/2 Package Extra-Firm Tofu, sliced into thick rectangles   
* ½ tsp Kosher Salt
* 2 tablespoons [Gochugaru](https://amzn.to/2P1lLmx)
* ¼ tsp Ground Black Pepper

#### STOVE-TOP INSTRUCTIONS 

1. In a [saucepan](https://amzn.to/3oKaYN7), add the water, fish sauce, soy sauce, Gochochang, and [Better than Bouillion](https://amzn.to/3oM8L3W). If you're adding dried mushrooms to the dish, you can also add them during this step to re-hydrate them. Cover and cook for 10-15 minutes over medium heat, adjusting the temperature to maintain a gentle simmer. 
2. While the stock is cooking, make a paste using the Gochugaru, 2 tsp sesame oil, and ground black pepper. Set aside. 
3. In a [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3lC91Pi) or [earthenware pot](https://amzn.to/3soWXDL), saute the kimchi until it becomes soft. Set it aside. 
4. In the same pot, add 1 tbsp sesame oil over medium heat. Then add the onion, garlic, and scallion whites. Cook until the onions become translucent and soften for about 8 minutes. 
5. Add the reserved stock to the pot. Cover cook for 5-7 minutes over medium heat. Then, open and stir in the reserved kimchi.
6. Next, add the tofu and let the mixture simmer for a few minutes before gently stirring in the reserved spice mixture- careful not to break up the tofu. 
7. Garnish with extra Gochugaru if you prefer spicy kimchi jjigae, and serve with a side of sticky rice. 

### ABOUT THE MEAL

Kimchi jjigae, kimchi chigae, kimchi stew, or kimchi soup (whichever name you choose to call it), is quickly becoming a favorite in our home. This is mainly due to its flexible ingredients and how easy it is to make. This kimchi tofu soup is rich and flavorful and can be made on the stove-top or in an Instant Pot [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3DpZGSo).

#### What are the main kimchi jjigae ingredients?

* Broth: A more [traditional Korean broth](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/kimchi-jjigae) includes dried anchovy, kelp, and daikon radish, all of which create a delicious base for kimchi stew. Since these ingredients can be hard to come by, I chose to use staples I usually have in my pantry. Note: If you prefer more of the kimchi flavor in your jjigae, consider adding 1-2 tbsp of the kimchi brine to flavor your broth. 

* Tofu: I use large, rectangular slices in my soup, and while traditional kimchi jjigae usually includes meat, we stick with tofu as the main protein. Occasionally, I will add shiitake mushrooms, fresh or dried, to change things up a bit. 

* Kimchi: Guess what? Kimchi is not just a side dish in Korean cuisine; it is often the main ingredient for many recipes. From what I hear, the best kimchi jjigae is the result of using kimchi that's been sitting in your fridge for a while. We tested this theory to see if it is true, and we can confirm 10/10.  

* Spices: [Gochugaru](https://amzn.to/2P1lLmx) and [Gochochang](https://amzn.to/2NHrNZ3) flavor the stew with traditional Korean spice. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [saucepan](https://amzn.to/3oKaYN7)
* A small bowl 
* A [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3lC91Pi), [earthenware pot](https://amzn.to/3soWXDL), or [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3DpZGSo)

#### Is kimchi jjigae vegetarian? Is it vegan?

To make this kimchi stew recipe vegetarian and vegan-friendly, omit the fish sauce, and be sure to use [Vegetable Better than Bouillion](https://amzn.to/3f8LK6e). 

#### Can I freeze this Korean kimchi soup? 

You sure can, but before freezing, remove the tofu from the dish. It doesn't reheat well once it has been frozen. Then, add the rest of the stew to a freezer-safe container or bag. The kimchi stew will freeze for up to 3 months.
