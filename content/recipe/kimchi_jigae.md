### ABOUT THE MEAL

Kimchi jjigae or kimchi stew is becoming a quick favorite in our home, mainly because of the flexible ingredients and how easy it is to make. I still need to get my hands on one of those cute earthenware bowls the stew is prepared and served in. 

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Broth: A more traditional Korean broth includes dried anchovy and seaweed, both of which make for a delicious broth. Since these ingredients are difficult to come by, I chose to use staples I usually have in my pantry for the broth instead. 

* Tofu: I like using large slices of tofu for this dish. Traditionally, kimchi jjigae is made with meat, but I think prefer it with only tofu. Occasionally, I will add shiitake mushrooms to change things up a bit. When I do this, I add them at the same time as the tofu in the recipe. 

* Kimchi: It's not just a side dish in Korean cuisine; it is the main ingredient of many recipes as well. From what I hear, the best kimchi jjigae is the result of using the kimchi in your refrigerator-that has long been forgotten about.

* Korean Spices: Gochugaru and Gochochang flavor the stew. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A saucepan 
* A small bowl 
* A dutch oven

#### Is this kimchi jjigae vegetarian? Is this kimchi jjigae Vegan?

This kimchi stew suits a vegetarian diet. To make this dish vegan-friendly, you will need to omit the fish sauce from the recipe and be sure to use the Vegetable Better than Bouillion. 

#### Can I freeze the kimchi jjigae? 

You sure can, but before freezing, remove the tofu from the dish. It doesn't reheat well. Then add the rest of the contents to a freezer-safe container. The kimchi stew will freeze for up to 3 months.
