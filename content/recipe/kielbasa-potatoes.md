* 1/2 Red Bell Pepper, julienne

#### Stove-Top Instructions

1. Preheat a [skillet](https://amzn.to/3lfBGLa) over medium-high heat.

3. Once the kielbasa is cooked through, set it aside. 
4. In the same [skillet](https://amzn.to/3lfBGLa), add the potatoes, season with salt and parsely, and then cook on medium heat for about 10-15 minutes. 
5. Next, add the peppers and reduce to low heat. Cook for another 10 minutes, and then return the kielbasa to the pan. 

#### Oven Instructions 

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and prepare a [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3I126tD). 
2. Spread the keilbasa and potatoes onto the [baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3I126tD). Season the potatoes with salt and parsely. Set the peppers aside. 
3. Bake for 15 minutes, then add the peppers and mix everything on the pan together, spreading around the oil from the keilbasa. Bake for another 10-15 minutes.

### About the Meal 

In college, my sister and I were roommates and living on a budgets. To make great-tasting meals we had to get creative; this was before Pinterest afterall. Out of our boredom and budget, this recipe was made. This recipe is for sheet-pan baked kielbasa, potatoes, peppers. It can be cooked in the oven or on the stove-top. Kielbasa, potatoes, and peppers is the ultimate weeknight meal, especially since it is cooked all in one place and done in 30 minutes.

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Red or Yukon God Potatoes: Use red or yukon gold potatoes, or a combination of the two. You can easily substitute whatever potatoes you have on hand. Just be sure to cut the potatoes into about one-inch pieces so they roast at the same pace as the other ingredients. 

* Kielbasa: I use kielbasa for this recipe, but get creative. You could easily substitute italian sausage, andouille, chicken sausage, or chorizo and end up with a tasty meal. 

* Yellow Bell Pepper

* Red Bell Pepper

* Kosher Salt

* Parsely: Unlike most of my recipes, I like dried parsley for this recipe. Use can use fresh parsley to brighten the plate and bring a peppery taste to this dish.
