#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 -4 oz [Thai Red Curry Paste](https://amzn.to/2NmwVBf), the whole can for spicy, 1/2 can for mild
* 1/2 tsp Ginger Paste
* 1/3 White Onion, thinly sliced
* 3-4 Chicken thighs, boneless and skinless, cut into 1-inch pieces 
* 1/2 Red Bell Pepper, thinly sliced 
* 1 small Zucchini, thinly sliced into rounds 
* 1- 14 oz can [Coconut Milk](https://amzn.to/2Zjwtq0), plus more if you prefer less spicy 
* 1 tbsp [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/2Zi2peI)
* 1/2 cup Mushrooms of your choice, quartered
* Thai Basil, for garnish 

#### STOVE-TOP INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Warm the red curry paste and ginger paste in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
2. Add the onions and chicken to the pan and stir to coat. Fry for 3-5 minutes, then add the bell peppers and zucchini, saute for another minute.
3. Stir in half of the coconut milk and bring the curry to a boil.
4. Reduce the heat to a light simmer and add the remaining coconut milk and fish sauce, along with the mushrooms. Allow the mixture to cook for 10 minutes. The curry should thicken, and the vegetables will reach a crisp-tenderness. If the curry does not thicken, add 2 tbsp cold water and stir to mix.
5. Garnish with Thai basil leaves and serve with jasmine rice.

#### INSTANT POT INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Warm the red curry paste and ginger paste in an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/2QR1gcY) on saute mode until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
2. Add the onions and chicken, stir to coat. Fry for 3-5 minutes, then add the bell peppers and zucchini, saute for another minute.
3. Stir in half of the coconut milk. Bring the curry to a boil in saute mode, and then add the mushrooms.
4. Secure the lid and set the Instant Pot to manual high pressure for 5 minutes with a quick release. If the curry is thin, add 2 tsp cold water. Stir to mix.
5. Remove the lid and add the remaining coconut milk and fish sauce.
6. Garnish with Thai basil leaves and serve with jasmine rice.

### ABOUT THE MEAL

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken: Chicken thighs are a personal favorite for Thai Curry. 

* Thai Curry Paste: We searched for the best Thai curry paste. [Maesri](https://amzn.to/2NmwVBf) comes out the winner every time! It is also one of the few Thai curry pastes that also happen to be vegetarian and vegan-friendly. 

* Vegetables: I use onions, red bell peppers, zucchini, and mushrooms for this recipe. 

* Coconut Milk: Here is the kicker, the brand and type of coconut milk you use will change the flavor and texture of the curry completely. I recommend using full-fat coconut milk. My favorite is [Aroy-D](https://amzn.to/2Zjwtq0).

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A heavy-bottomed pan or [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/2QR1gcY)

#### Can I make Thai Red Curry vegetarian? Can I make it vegan?

Suggested substitutions: 

* Protein: Instead of meat, use tofu or double the volume and variety of vegetables used. 

* Be sure to omit the fish sauce. It won't alter the flavor of the dish too much.
