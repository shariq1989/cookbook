#### INGREDIENTS

* 1 Red Onion, finely chopped
* 3 Garlic Cloved, minced
* 1-inch Ginger piece, minced 
* 1-2 large Tomatoes, chopped, use more if you prefer more salan 
* 1/2 cup Water 
* 1 tsp [Turmeric Powder](https://amzn.to/3vyvAZK)
* 1-2 tsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC), depending on your prefered heat
* 1 tsp [Garam Masala](https://amzn.to/3u0tvEX)
* 1 tsp [Coriander](https://amzn.to/3lwbJ92), ground 
* 1-3 Thai Green Chili or Serrano Chilis, split lengthwise 
* 1 tsp [Cumin Seeds](https://amzn.to/3vBeR8i)
* 1 tsp [Kolongi Seeds](https://amzn.to/3jMZUuh), plus more to sprinkle 
* 1/2 cup Cilantro, chopped 
* Salt, to taste

#### STOVE-TOP DIRECTIONS 

1. Heat the ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tsp kalonji seed, cumin seed, and chilis. Cook until they begin to sputter.
2. Add the onion, stirring frequently, until the onions brown and caramelize. This step may take a while, that’s okay. You are building flavor for the dish.
3. Next, add the garlic and ginger and stir to combine.
4. In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, turmeric, and garam masala. Stir the spices into the pan mixture until it becomes fragrant, about 30 seconds.
5. Add the tomatoes and allow the mixture to simmer for about 5 minutes.
6. Remove the green chilis and set them aside. Then remove the entire mixture from heat and put it into a food processor, blend until smooth.
7. Return the mixture to the pan, along with the reserved chilis. Then add the chickpeas, cilantro, 1/2 cup water, and bring it to a simmer.
8. Sprinkle the dish with kalonji seeds and cover the pan with the lid slightly ajar. Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle bubbling. Cook, stirring occasionally until the liquid has reduced, about 12-15 minutes.
9. Season with salt, to taste, and garnish with cilantro. Serve with long-grain basmati rice or naan.

### ABOUT THE MEAL

Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with Desi food. If you asked me the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry, I couldn’t have told you, so learning how to cook Indian food is near and dear to my heart. It’s been an honor to study Desi cooking under my talented mother-in-law. She prepares food off-script; you have to watch her closely as she buzzes through the kitchen, or you miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build upon flavors and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by what I have learned cooking alongside her.

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Chickpeas: We used canned simply because it is easier and takes less time to cook. You can use dry chickpeas, but you will need to soak them for 6-24 hours and increase the cooking time, about 1-2 hours.

* Onion and Tomato Masala: The slow-cooked onion and tomatoes, along with ginger, garlic, and green chilis, bring so much flavor to the dish. 

* Garam Masala: India is a vast country with varying sub-cultures, and as a result, Indian food differs from region to region. The same thing applies to specific spices used as well. For example, garam masala is a necessary ingredient for butter chicken, but each garam masala blend differs depending on its origin. For this reason, I suggest making garam masala at home, so you can control the amount of each spice used in the mix and cater it specifically to your preferences. If you choose to go the store-bought route, I suggest [Rani](https://amzn.to/3qNCcQk), Spice House, or Penzey’s garam masala.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A heavy-bottomed pan with a lid
* A small bowl
* A food processor or blender

#### Is channa masala vegetarian? Is channa masala vegan? 

Channa masala caters well to both a vegetarian and vegan diet. To make this particular recipe vegan, you will need to substitute another oil for the ghee. I suggest using [grapeseed oil](https://amzn.to/3cLwWYG).

#### Can I freeze channa masala? 

Yes, first allow the dish to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container. Channa masala will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it on the stovetop and enjoy.
