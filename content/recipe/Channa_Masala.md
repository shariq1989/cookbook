Servings: 4-6 <!--more-->

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 2- 15 oz can Chickpeas (Garbanzo Beans), drained and rinced 
* 1 Red Onion, finely chopped
* 3 Garlic Cloved, minced
* 1-inch Ginger piece, minced 
* 1 large Tomato, chopped
* 1/2 cup Water 
* 2 tbsp Ghee (if making vegan, use canola) 
* 1 tsp Turmeric Powder
* 2 tsp Kashmiri Chili Powder
* 1 tsp Garam Masala
* 1 tsp Coriander, ground 
* 1-3 Green Chili, split lengthwise 
* 1 tsp Cumin Seeds
* 1 tsp Kolongi Seeds (Black Mustard Seed), plus more to sprinkle 
* 1/2 cup Cilantro, chopped 
* Salt, to taste

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Heat the ghee in a heavy bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the black mustard seed, cumin seed, and chilis until they begin to sputter.
2. Add the onion, stirring frequently, until onions brown and caramalize (not burn or char). This step may take a while, that's okay. You are building flavor for the dish. 
3. Add the garlic and ginger and stir to combine. 
4. In a small bowl, add the chili powder, turmeric, and garam masala. Stir into the mixture until fragrant, about 30 seconds. 
5. Add the tomatoes and simmer, about 5 minutes.
6. Remove the green chilis, set aside, and then remove the mixture from heat and place in a food processor, blend until smooth. 
7. Reture the mixture to the pan, along with the reserved chilis and add the chickpeas and cilantro, along with 1/2 cup water, bring to a simmer. 
8. Sprinkle the masala with more kolongi seeds and cover with lid slightly ajar, and reduce heat to maintain a gentle bubbling. 
9. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has reduced into a thick stew, about 20 minutes.
10. Garnish with cilantro and serve with long-grain basmati rice or naan. 

#### THE STORY BEHIND THE MEAL 
Chana masala is so incredibly flavorful and happens to be one of the most popular North Indian and Pakistani vegetarian dishes. Itâ€™s a simple, healthy meal to make that caters to vegetarians, vegans, and those who are gluten-free. 

Before meeting Shariq, I (Tressa) had no experience with eating or making Desi food. In fact, if you asked me the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry I couldn't have told you. I am incredibly honored to be able to study Desi cooking under my mother-in-law, who is a phenomenal cook. She cooks off script so you have to observe carefully as she buzzes through the kitchen or you miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build upon flavors to create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by her cooking, though I am sure hers would be even more tasty.
