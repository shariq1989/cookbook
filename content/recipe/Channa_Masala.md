#### INGREDIENTS 

* 2 tbsp [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW) (if making vegan, use canola) 
* 2- 15 oz can Chickpeas, drained and rinced 
* 1 Red Onion, finely chopped
* 3 Garlic Cloved, minced
* 1-inch Ginger piece, minced 
* 1-2 large Tomatoes, chopped, use more if you prefer more salan 
* 1/2 cup Water 
* 1 tsp Turmeric Powder
* 1-2 tsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC), depending on your prefered heat
* 1 tsp [Garam Masala](https://amzn.to/3u0tvEX)
* 1 tsp Coriander, ground 
* 1-3 Thai Green Chili or Serrano Chilis, split lengthwise 
* 1 tsp Cumin Seeds
* 1 tsp [Kolongi Seeds](https://amzn.to/3jMZUuh), plus more to sprinkle 
* 1/2 cup Cilantro, chopped 
* Salt, to taste

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Heat the ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tsp kalonji seed, cumin seed, and chilis. Cook until they begin to sputter.
2. Add the onion, stirring frequently, until the onions brown and caramelize. This step may take a while, that’s okay. You are building flavor for the dish.
3. Next, add the garlic and ginger and stir to combine.
4. In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, turmeric, and garam masala. Stir the spices into the pan mixture until it becomes fragrant, about 30 seconds.
5. Add the tomatoes and allow the mixture to simmer for about 5 minutes.
6. Remove the green chilis and set them aside. Then remove the entire mixture from heat and put it into a food processor, blend until smooth.
7. Return the mixture to the pan, along with the reserved chilis. Then add the chickpeas, cilantro, 1/2 cup water, and bring it to a simmer.
8. Sprinkle the dish with kalonji seeds and cover the pan with the lid slightly ajar. Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle bubbling. Cook, stirring occasionally until the liquid has reduced, about 12-15 minutes.
9. Season with salt, to taste, and garnish with cilantro. Serve with long-grain basmati rice or naan.

#### ABOUT THE MEAL

Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with Desi food. If you asked me about the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry, I couldn’t have told you, so learning how to cook Indian food is near and dear to my heart. It's been an honor to study Desi cooking under my talented mother-in-law. She prepares food off-script and you have to watch her closely as she buzzes through the kitchen, or you miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build upon flavors and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by what I have learned cooking alongside her.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A heavy-bottomed pan with a lid
* A small bowl
* A food processor or blender

#### Is channa masala vegetarian? Is channa masala vegan? 

Channa masala caters well to both a vegetarian and vegan diet. To make this particular recipe vegan, you will need to substitute another oil for the ghee. I suggest using grapeseed oil.

#### Can I freeze channa masala? 

Yes, first allow the dish to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container. Channa masala will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it on the stovetop and enjoy.
