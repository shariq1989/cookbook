Servings: 4-6 <!--more-->

Preparation Time: 1 hour

Cuisine: Indian, Pakistani

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 2 tbsp [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW) (if making vegan, use canola) 
* 2- 15 oz can Chickpeas, drained and rinced 
* 1 Red Onion, finely chopped
* 3 Garlic Cloved, minced
* 1-inch Ginger piece, minced 
* 1-2 large Tomatoes, chopped, use more if you prefer more salan 
* 1/2 cup Water 
* 1 tsp Turmeric Powder
* 1-2 tsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC), depending on your prefered heat
* 1 tsp [Garam Masala](https://amzn.to/3u0tvEX)
* 1 tsp Coriander, ground 
* 1-3 Thai Green Chili or Serrano Chilis, split lengthwise 
* 1 tsp Cumin Seeds
* 1 tsp [Kolongi Seeds](https://amzn.to/3jMZUuh), plus more to sprinkle 
* 1/2 cup Cilantro, chopped 
* Salt, to taste

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Heat the ghee in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the kalonji seed, cumin seed, and chilis until they begin to sputter.
2. Add the onion, stirring frequently, until onions brown and caramelize (not burn or char). This step may take a while, that’s okay. You are building flavor for the dish.
3. Next add the garlic and ginger and stir to combine.
4. In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, turmeric, and garam masala. Stir the spices into the pan mixture until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
5. Add the tomatoes and simmer for about 5 minutes.
6. Remove the green chilis, set aside, and then remove the entire mixture from heat and put it into a food processor, blend until smooth.
7. Return the mixture to the pan, along with the reserved chilis, and add the chickpeas and cilantro, along with 1/2 cup water, bring to a simmer.
8. Sprinkle the masala lightly with kalonji seeds and cover with lid slightly ajar. Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle bubbling. Cook, stirring occasionally until liquid has reduced into a thick stew, about 12-15 minutes.
9. Taste with salt, if needed, and garnish with cilantro. Serve with long-grain basmati rice or naan.

#### ABOUT THE MEAL

Chana masala, also called Chole is a bright and flavorful dish. It also happens to be one of the most popular vegetarian dishes in Northern India and Pakistan, which is also where Shariq's family originates. It’s a simple, healthy meal to make that caters to vegetarians, vegans, and those who are gluten-free. 

Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with eating or making Desi food. If you asked me the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry I couldn't have told you. Now, I am incredibly honored to be able to study Desi cooking under my mother-in-law. She cooks off-script so I have to carefully observe her as she buzzes through the kitchen or I  miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build flavor and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by her cooking, though I am sure hers would be even tastier.
