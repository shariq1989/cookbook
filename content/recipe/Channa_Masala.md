1. Heat the ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tsp kalonji seed, cumin seed, and chilis. Cook until they begin to sputter.

### ABOUT THE MEAL

Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with Desi food. If you asked me the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry, I couldn’t have told you. Learning how to cook Indian food is something I treasure, especially since I have the honor of learning Desi cooking under my talented mother-in-law. She prepares food off-script, so you have to watch her closely as she buzzes through the kitchen, or you miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build upon flavors and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by what I have learned cooking alongside her.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chickpeas: We used canned simply because it is easier and takes less time to cook. You can use dry chickpeas, but you will need to soak them for 6-24 hours and increase the cooking time, about 1-2 hours.

* Onion and Tomato: The slow-cooked onion and tomatoes, along with ginger, garlic, and green chilis, bring so much flavor to the dish. 

* Garam Masala: India is a vast country with varying sub-cultures, and as a result, Indian food differs from region to region. The same thing applies to specific spices used as well. For this reason, I suggest making garam masala at home, so you can control the amount of each spices used in the mix and cater it specifically to your preferences. Here is the [garam masala](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/pakistani_garam_masala/) we make in our home. If you choose to go the store-bought route, I suggest [Rani](https://amzn.to/3qNCcQk), Spice House, or Penzey’s garam masala.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A heavy-bottomed pan with a lid or an Instant Pot
* A small bowl
* A food processor or blender

#### Is channa masala vegetarian? Is it vegan? 

Channa masala caters to a vegetarian and vegan diet. To make this particular recipe vegan, you will need to substitute another oil for the ghee. I suggest using [grapeseed oil](https://amzn.to/3cLwWYG).

#### Can I freeze channa masala? 

Yes, first allow the dish to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container. Channa masala will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it on the stovetop and enjoy.
