#### INGREDIENTS 

* 2 tbsp [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW) (if making vegan, use canola) 
* 2- 15 oz can Chickpeas, drained and rinced 
* 1 Red Onion, finely chopped
* 3 Garlic Cloved, minced
* 1-inch Ginger piece, minced 
* 1-2 large Tomatoes, chopped, use more if you prefer more salan 
* 1/2 cup Water 
* 1 tsp Turmeric Powder
* 1-2 tsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC), depending on your prefered heat
* 1 tsp [Garam Masala](https://amzn.to/3u0tvEX)
* 1 tsp Coriander, ground 
* 1-3 Thai Green Chili or Serrano Chilis, split lengthwise 
* 1 tsp Cumin Seeds
* 1 tsp [Kolongi Seeds](https://amzn.to/3jMZUuh), plus more to sprinkle 
* 1/2 cup Cilantro, chopped 
* Salt, to taste

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Heat the ghee in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tsp kalonji seed, cumin seed, and chilis. Cook until they begin to sputter.
2. Add the onion, stirring frequently, until the onions brown and caramelize. This step may take a while, that’s okay. You are building flavor for the dish.
3. Next, add the garlic and ginger and stir to combine.
4. In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, turmeric, and garam masala. Stir the spices into the pan mixture until it becomes fragrant, about 30 seconds.
5. Add the tomatoes and allow the mixture to simmer for about 5 minutes.
6. Remove the green chilis and set them aside. Then remove the entire mixture from heat and put it into a food processor, blend until smooth.
7. Return the mixture to the pan, along with the reserved chilis. Then add the chickpeas, cilantro, 1/2 cup water, and bring it to a simmer.
8. Sprinkle the dish with kalonji seeds and cover the pan with the lid slightly ajar. Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle bubbling. Cook, stirring occasionally until the liquid has reduced, about 12-15 minutes.
9. Season with salt, to taste, and garnish with cilantro. Serve with long-grain basmati rice or naan.


#### ABOUT THE MEAL

Chana masala, also called chole, is bright, flavorful, and filling. It also happens to be one of the most popular vegetarian dishes of Northern India and Pakistan, where Shariq's family is from. 

Learning to make Indian food is near and dear to my heart. Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with eating or making Desi food. If you asked me back then what the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry, I couldn’t have told you. Since then, it has been an honor to study under my mother-in-law, who happens to be a phenomenal cook. She makes meals off-script so you have to watch her closely as she buzzes through the kitchen or you will miss it all. I am continually amazed by her ability to build upon flavors and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by what I have learned cooking alongside her.

#### Is channa masala vegetarian? Is channa masala vegan? 

Channa masala is a simple meal that caters to vegetarians, vegans, and those who are gluten-free. To make this recipe completely vegan you will need to substitute another oil for the ghee. I suggest using grapeseed oil.
