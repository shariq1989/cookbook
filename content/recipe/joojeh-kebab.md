### How to Make Joojeh Kebabs 

#### Ingredients 

For the Marinade: 

* 1 tbsp Milk 
* 1/8 tsp Saffron Stems
* 4 Chicken Breasts, boneless and skinless, cut into 2-inch pieces 
* 1 small White Onion, thinly sliced 
* 1/3 cup Lemon Juice 
* 1/4 tsp Kosher Salt 
* 1/4 tsp Black Pepper, coarse ground  
* 1/4 cup Olive Oil, plus more for brushing over the vegetables 

For the Kebab: 

* 3-4 small Tomatoes on the Vine, whole 
* 3-4 small Red Onions, cut in half  
* 2-3 Serrano Peppers, whole 
* Salt and Pepper, to taste 

#### Instructions 

For the Marinade: 

1. In a small bowl, soak the saffron stems in 2 tbsp warm milk for 5 minutes. Set aside
2. Trim fat from the chicken breasts, and then cut them into 2-inch pieces. Put them into a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3p2YLle)
3. Next, add the onion slices, lemon juice, reserved saffron mixture, salt, and pepper. Toss to coat, ensuring all chicken pieces take on the rich saffron color. Then stir in the olive oil to combine.
4. Cover the bowl and allow the chicken to marinate in the fridge for 24 hours. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before grilling. 

For the Kebab: 

1. Prepare the grill by removing the grate and setting it to high heat. 
2. Using [narrow skewers](https://amzn.to/3cZj1yz), and skewer the tomatoes, onions, and serrano. Brush them lightly with oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste. 
3. Next, skewer the chicken using [wide skewers](https://amzn.to/3E8BxAs). 
4. Rest the skewers on the grill, about 4-5 inches from the flame or coals. If the grill is too small, be sure to grill the vegetables first. Keep them warm with aluminum foil while you grill the chicken. 
5. Place the chicken skewers on the grill. As soon as one side begins changing color, grill the other side to seal the juiciness of the chicken. Keep turning the skewers until they are golden brown on all sides. Check a piece by cutting into it with a knife. 
6. Remove the chicken and serve immediately with slices of lemon along with the vegetables and a nice side of our favorite [saffron rice]({{< ref "saffron-rice" >}}).
