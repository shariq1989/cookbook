#### INGREDIENTS 

* 3 lbs Chicken Thighs, bone-in and skin-on
* 1 1/2 tsp Turmeric
* 6 tbsp Olive Oil, divided
* Kosher Salt, to taste 
* Black Pepper, coarse ground, to taste
* ½ cup White Wine Vinegar 
* 1½ cup Green Olives, crushed 
* 2-4 Garlic Cloves, minced 
* 1 tbsp Fresh Parsley, chopped 

#### INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees. 
2. Place the chicken into a bag with olive oil and turmeric. Mix well. 
3. In a 9x13 baking dish, add the chicken thighs and season them with salt and pepper. 
4. Be sure the chicken is skin-side up, then pour vinegar over and around the chicken and place it in the oven. Bake without flipping for 25-35 minutes. 
5. In a small bowl, combine the crushed olives (I crush the olives with a fork beforehand), garlic, parsley, and the remaining olive oil (3 tbsp), as well as 2 tbsp of water.
6. Once the chicken is cooked, remove the baking dish and transfer the chicken thighs to a serving tray, leaving the juices behind. 
7. Pour the reserved olive mixture into the baking dish. Using a spoon, gently scrape up the bits of chicken left behind, letting the olive oil mixture mingle with the rendered fat. Mixed well, and pour the dressing over the chicken to serve.

### ABOUT THE MEAL

This recipe is inspired by Alison Roman’s "Vinegar Chicken with Crushed Olive Dressing;" this is an easy weeknight meal that roasts in under 1 hour.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken: I use whole chicken pieces or chicken thighs when I make this recipe, but feel free to use whatever you prefer. Bone-in and skin-on will give you the best flavor. Feeding a crowd, why not use a whole chicken? Just be sure that you adjust the cooking time depending on your selection. The safe cooking temperature for chicken is 160 degrees.

* Turmeric: Not only does this spice flavor the chicken, it also lends the gorgeous yellow color. 

* Vinegar: The tanginess from the vinegar with the olive oil, ginger, and rendered fat from the chicken makes this meal irresistible.
