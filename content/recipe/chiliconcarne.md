Our authentic chili con carne recipe is easily prepared in the Instant Pot, dutch oven, or slow cooker. In the development phase of recipe creation, I experiment with different ingredients to find the right combination. That is true of our chili con carne as well. After testing many of the highly-debated ingredients, we favored the beef chuck and black beans duo overall. The tenderness of the chuck, cooked with the beans and chilies makes for the best chili con carne recipe I have ever tried; the chuck achieves a heartiness that is missing with other meat options. However, the real star of this dish, is the combination of chilies used- they flavor the dish without overwhelming the chili with heat. I know what you're thinking, meat is in the title-stick with me. You can make this chili con carne recipe vegetarian and vegan with a few substitutions. In place of the meat, use potatoes, cauliflower, and other vegetables, or simply double the number of black beans for a vegetable chilli con carne with beans. Replace the chicken broth with your favorite vegetable broth, and use. Chili con carne is naturally low carb and can be modified to fit a keto meal plan as well. Serve it as a stew without beans and paired with a low-carb tortilla. Like the dish itself, what it is served with is also is highly debated. We enjoy our chili con carne as a stew topped with onion, shredded cheese, cilantro, avocado, and thinly sliced chilies. Our meal is made complete with warm corn tortillas. Because chili con carne ingredients are so widely disputed, there is room to serve it however you'd like. As a stew, you can pair the chili with corn tortillas like we do or with tortilla chips, flour tortillas, or cornbread. Hey, this is the Texas state dish after all. I have even seen chili con carne served over rice or macaroni noodles. You could also pair it with a side of Mexican rice. The moral of the story is- get creative and adjust the meal to your family's preference. Either way, we know it is a meal that you and those around you will enjoy."

### About the Meal 

My husband is a self-proclaimed chili-hater, and he absolutely loves this recipe! Chili Con Carne means 'chili with meat' and is made of tender beef, beans, and a variety of chilies for maximum flavor. Our authentic chili con carne recipe is easily prepared in the Instant Pot, dutch oven, or slow cooker. We hope you enjoy the best chili con carne recipe and one that our family loves.

#### Chili Con Carne Ingredients: 

In the development phase of recipe creation, I experiment with different ingredients to find the right combination. That is true of our chili con carne as well. After testing many of the highly-debated ingredients, we favored the beef chuck and black beans duo overall. The tenderness of the chuck, cooked with the beans and chilies makes for the best chili con carne recipe I have ever tried; the chuck achieves a heartiness that is missing with other meat options. However, the real star of this dish, in my opinion, is the combination of chilies used- they flavor the dish without overwhelming the chili with heat.

* [Chilis](https://amzn.to/319rInn): I use Arbol, guajillo, and chipotles to flavor the stew. 

* [Chipotles En Adobo](https://amzn.to/3f0lZoT)

* Chicken Broth 

* Beef Chuck: Beef Chuck is marbled with fat and ideal for this stew, but be sure to sear it to seal in all the flavor. 

* Olive Oil 

* Onion 

* Spices: I use salt, pepper, cinnamon, cumin, allspice, and Mexican oregano. 

* Fish Sauce 

* Apple Cider Vinegar

* Garlic 

* Black Beans: The addition of beans in chili is highly debated depending on where you're from, but in this recipe, they are a must-have. 

* Worcestershire Sauce 

* Tomato Paste 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/2YHB09g), [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ), or [slow cooker](https://amzn.to/3omieNl)
* A [frying pan](https://amzn.to/3qv4Jhd) (if using a slow cooker)
* A [food processor](https://amzn.to/3bUKS2q),[blender](https://amzn.to/3H5anfT), or [immersion blender](https://amzn.to/3rhbcwE)

#### Can I make chili con carne vegetarian? Can I make vegan chili con carne?

I know what you're thinking, "meat" is in the title-stick with me. You can make this chili con carne recipe vegetarian and vegan with a few substitutions. 

In place of the meat, use potatoes, cauliflower, and other vegetables, or simply double the number of black beans for a vegetable chilli con carne with beans. Replace the chicken broth with your favorite vegetable broth, and use [Marmite](https://amzn.to/3CYF1Eq) instead of fish sauce. Skip the Worcestershire as it has trace amounts of anchovy in it; not having it won't alter the recipe too much.  

#### Is chili con carne keto or low-carb?

Served as a stew without beans and paired with a low-carb [tortilla](https://amzn.to/3ePAoDU), it sure is! We calculated the macros to make it easier for you. Note, this calculation was made without beans and does not include any toppings or tortillas. The serving size is 1 1/2 cup of stew. 

* CARBS-- 4 net carbs
* PROTEIN-- 32g 
* FAT--36g

#### What is chili con carne traditionally served with? 

Like the dish itself, this too is highly debated. We enjoy our chili con carne as a stew topped with onion, shredded cheese, cilantro, avocado, and thinly sliced chilies. Our meal is made complete with warm corn tortillas. 

Because chili con carne ingredients are so widely disputed, there is room to serve it however you'd like. As a stew, you can pair the chili with corn tortillas like we do or with [tortilla chips]({{< ref "corn-tortilla-chips" >}}), corn chips, flour tortillas, or cornbread. Hey, this is the Texas state dish after all. I have even seen chili con carne served over rice or macaroni noodles. You could also pair it with a side of [Mexican Rice]({{< ref "mexican-rice" >}}). The moral of the story is- get creative and adjust the meal to your family's preference. Either way, we know it is a meal that you and those around you will enjoy.  

#### Can I freeze chili con carne?

You sure can. First, allow the dish to cool completely. Next, add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. Chili con carne will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm the stew on the stove and prepare all of your toppings.
