Preparation Time: 20 minutes 

Cook Time: 40 minutes 

Cuisine: Indian

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 stick Unsalted Butter, divided 
* 5 [Green Cardamom Pods](https://amzn.to/3tZaNOd), lightly crushed
* 1 Cinnamon Stick
* 4 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 1 tbsp Ginger, grated
* 2 Green Chilis, slit lengthwise, plus more to garnish
* 1 tsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC) 
* Â½ tsp [Garam Masala](https://amzn.to/3u0tvEX)
* 3 medium Tomatoes, chopped 
* 1/2 cup Heavy Cream
* 3-5 Chicken Thighs, skinless, bone-in
* Salt to taste
* Cilantro, chopped, to garnish

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a heavy-bottomed pan, warm 1 1/2 tbsp of butter. Add the green cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, and garlic. Cook until the ingredients begin to sputter.
2. Add the ginger and green chilies and fry the mixture for 1 minute.
3. Stir the Kashmiri chili powder, garam masala, and tomatoes into the mixture and simmer for about 5 minutes. 
4. Remove the cinnamon stick and pour the mixture into a food processor. Collect the reserved butter, cut it into cubes and add them to the food processor as well. Blend until smooth. You could also use an immersion blender for this step.  
5. Return the mixture to the pan. Lower the heat and nestle the chicken thighs into the pan. Cover with a lid and allow the dish to maintain a gentle bubble, stirring occasionally, for 25-30 minutes. 
6. Remove from heat and allow it to cool for a few minutes before adding the heavy cream- doing so, helps to maintain the thick, creaminess of the sauce. Stir in the cream until it is thoroughly combined. 
7. Garnish with cilantro and green chilis and serve with basmati rice or naan.

#### ABOUT THE MEAL

Butter chicken or murgh makhani originated in Dehli, India, and later spread throughout the western world. It's no wonder why since this butter chicken recipe offers a great introduction to the flavor and spices of Indian cooking. For that reason, this one of the dishes we reach for most often when entertaining guests over who have never tasted Indian food before. It also happens to be my most requested recipe from friends and family. 

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

Chicken: Bone-in chicken thighs are a personal family preference, however, you can substitute boneless thighs or chicken breasts. If using chicken breasts, cut them into 1-inch pieces and use the suggested cook time for this recipe. If using boneless chicken thighs, reduce the cooking time to about 20 minutes to prevent overcooking. As always, the safe cooking temperature for chicken is 160 degrees.
