#### ABOUT THE MEAL

Butter chicken or murgh makhani originated in India and was heavily influenced by British colonization. The dish later spread throughout the western world, primarily because it offers a gentle introduction to the flavor and spices of Indian cooking. We don't make this too often for our family at home, but this is a go-to when we have guests over. 

Learning to make Indian food is near and dear to my heart. Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with eating or making Desi food. If you asked me back then what the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry, I couldn’t have told you. Since then, it has been an honor to study under my mother-in-law, who happens to be a phenomenal cook. She makes meals off-script so you have to watch her closely as she buzzes through the kitchen or you will miss it all. I am continually amazed by her ability to build upon flavors and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by what I have learned cooking alongside her.
