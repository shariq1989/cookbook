#### THE STORY BEHIND THE MEAL

Butter chicken or murgh makhani originated in North India as a curry but later spread through the western world. Its popularity grew mainly because of how easy it is to make, but it also offers and gentle introduction to some of the more flavorful and spicy dishes known in India. We don't make this too often in our home for just us, but when we have guests over, this is a go-to crowd-pleaser.
