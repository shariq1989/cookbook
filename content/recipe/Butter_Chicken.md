#### STOVE-TOP DIRECTIONS 

For the Chicken: 

1. In a large bowl, toss the chicken with the ginger paste, garlic paste, Kashmiri chili powder, and salt. Set aside to marinate for 20 minutes
2. In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat the ghee and fry the marinated chicken until the pieces have become golden brown, about 15 minutes. Set aside. 

For the Curry: 

1. In the same pan, warm 1 1/2 tbsp of butter. Add the green cardamom pods and cinnamon stick. Cook until the ingredients begin to sputter, then add the onions. Cook the onions until they become translucent and soften. 
2. Next, add the garlic, ginger, and green chilies and cook for another minute.
3. Stir in the Kashmiri chili powder, garam masala, cumin, salt, turmeric, and tomatoes into the mixture. Cook for 5-7 minutes and allow the tomatoes to simmer. 
4. Remove the cinnamon stick (and green chilis, if you want it to be less spicy) and pour the mixture into a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth. You could also use an immersion blender for this step.  
5. Return the mixture to the pan over low heat and stir in the butter and cream. Then, nestle the reserved chicken into the pan. Allow the dish to maintain a gentle bubble for 5-7 minutes. Adjust the temperature as necessary. 
6. Garnish the butter chicken with cilantro and green chilis and serve with basmati rice or naan.

#### INSTANT POT DIRECTIONS

For the Chicken: 

1. In a large bowl, toss the chicken with the ginger paste, garlic paste, Kashmiri chili powder, and salt. Set aside to marinate for 20 minutes
2. In an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/2OCQYfN), heat ghee and fry the marinated chicken until the pieces have become golden brown, about 15 minutes. Set aside. 

For the Curry: 

1. In the same [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/2OCQYfN), warm 1 1/2 tbsp of butter on saute mode. Add the green cardamom pods and cinnamon stick. Cook until the ingredients begin to sputter, then add the onions. Cook the onions until they become translucent and soften. 
2. Next, add the garlic, ginger, and green chilies and cook for another minute.
3. Stir in the Kashmiri chili powder, garam masala, cumin, salt, turmeric, and tomatoes into the mixture. Cook for 5-7 minutes and allow the tomatoes to simmer. 
4. Add the chicken pieces to the top of the Instant Pot. 
5. Secure the lid, set the Instant Pot to manual high pressure for 5 minutes, and let it release naturally for 5 minutes before doing a quick release. 
6. Remove the chicken, and set it aside. Remove the cinnamon stick, and discard. 
7. Pour the mixture into a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth. You could also use an [immersion blender](https://amzn.to/30O0Ndo) for this step. 
8. Return the mixture to the Instant Pot, and stir in the butter and cream until well incorporated. Then, nestle the cooked chicken back into the pan. Allow the dish to maintain a gentle bubble for 5 minutes, stirring regularly.

#### ABOUT THE MEAL

Butter chicken originated in Dehli, India, and later spread throughout the western world. That makes sense because it offers a great introduction to the flavor and spices of Indian cooking. For that reason, this is one of the dishes we reach for most often when entertaining guests who have never tasted Indian food before. It also happens to be my most requested recipe from friends and family. 

Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with Desi food. If you asked me the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry, I could not have told you. Learning how to cook Indian food is something I treasure, especially since I have the honor of learning Desi cooking under my talented mother-in-law. She prepares food off-script, so you have to watch her closely as she buzzes through the kitchen, or you miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build upon flavors and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by what I have learned cooking alongside her.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Chicken: We use boneless chicken thighs, but you can substitute chicken breasts if you prefer. If using chicken breasts, follow the same cooking time, and be sure to cut the chicken into 1-inch pieces. 
-- The safe cooking temperature for chicken is 160 degrees. 

* Butter: We prefer to use high-quality butter, like Kerrygold, since butter is central to the dish; any butter should be fine. 

* Cream: I prefer using heavy cream because it blends well without being too temperamental. 

* Garam Masala: India is a vast country with varying sub-cultures, and as a result, Indian food differs from region to region. The same is true of specific spices as well. Garam masala is a necessary ingredient for butter chicken, but every garam masala blend differs based on its origin. For this reason, I suggest making your garam masala, so you can control the amount of each spice used in the mix and cater it specifically to your preferences. If you choose to go the store-bought route, I suggest [Rani](https://amzn.to/3eqFSFa), Spice House, or Penzey's garam masala. 

* Tomatoes: I use fresh ingredients whenever possible, but you can also use canned, diced tomatoes. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A heavy-bottomed pan or [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/2Qb5T1j)
* A food processor, blender, or [immersion blender](https://amzn.to/30O0Ndo)

#### Can butter chicken be vegetarian? Can it be vegan? Can it be dairy-free? 

This recipe caters well to a vegetarian, vegan, or dairy-free way of eating with a few modifications. 

* Vegetarian: First, we need to find a substitute for the chicken in this recipe. I recommend using chickpeas, baked firm tofu, paneer, or roasted cauliflower. For added protein, you can also include toasted cashews. If using cashews, add them when you add the onions.

* Vegan: I prefer using chickpeas, baked firm tofu, or roasted cauliflower in place of the chicken. They come out delicious and hold up well throughout the cooking process. For added protein, you can also include toasted cashews. If using cashews, add them when you add the onions. In place of butter, use either coconut oil or vegan butter, and you can use full-fat coconut milk as an alternative to the cream.

* Dairy-Free: In place of butter and cream, use coconut oil and full-fat [coconut milk](https://amzn.to/2ODAyDS).  

#### Is butter chicken keto or low-carb?

It is. We even calculated the macros for one chicken thigh and some of the sauce to make it easier for you.  

* CARBS– 5 Net Carbs
* PROTEIN– 26g
* FAT–41g

 We recommend serving a butter chicken dish with a side of cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, or keto naan. 

#### Can I freeze butter chicken?

Yes, first allow the dish to cool completely and add it to a freezer-safe container. It will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it on the stovetop and prepare your sides.
