Servings: 2-4 <!--more-->

Preparation Time: 20 minutes 

Cook Time: 50 minutes 

Cuisine: Indian

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 stick Butter, cubed and divided 
* 5 [Green Cardamom Pods](https://amzn.to/3tZaNOd), lightly crushed
* 1 Cinnamon Stick
* 4 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 1 tbsp Ginger, minced
* 2 Green Chilis, slit lengthwise, plus more to garnish
* 1 tsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC) 
* 1 1/2 tsp Garam Masala
* 1 tsp Cumin 
* 1 tsp Salt
* 1/2 tsp Turmeric 
* 3 medium Tomatoes, chopped 
* 1/3 cup Heavy Cream
* 3-5 Chicken Thighs, bone-in and skinless
* Cilantro, chopped, to garnish

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a heavy-bottomed pan, warm 1 1/2 tbsp of butter. Add the garlic, green cardamom pods, and cinnamon stick. Cook until the ingredients begin to sputter.
2. Add the ginger and green chilies and cook for another minute.
3. Stir the Kashmiri chili powder, garam masala, cumin, salt, turmeric, and tomatoes into the mixture. Cook for about 2 minutes. 
4. Remove the cinnamon stick and pour the mixture into a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth. You could also use an immersion blender for this step.  
5. Return the mixture to the pan. Lower the heat and nestle the chicken thighs into the pan. Allow the dish to maintain a gentle bubble for 25-30 minutes. Adjust the temperature as necessary. 
6. Remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool for about 5-10 minutes before adding the remaining butter and heavy cream. This step is necessary, so don't skip past it. If the dish doesn't cool before adding your cream and butter, the sauce will end up thin and watery. 
7. Return the pan to low heat and continuously stir in the butter and cream until it is thoroughly combined. 
8. Garnish with cilantro and green chilis and serve with basmati rice or naan.

#### ABOUT THE MEAL

Butter chicken originated in Dehli, India, and later spread throughout the western world. It's no wonder why since this butter chicken recipe offers a great introduction to the flavor and spices of Indian cooking. For that reason, this is one of the dishes we reach for most often when entertaining guests who have never tasted Indian food before. It also happens to be my most requested recipe from friends and family. 

Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with Desi food. If you asked me the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry, I couldn’t have told you, so learning how to cook Indian food is near and dear to my heart. It’s been an honor to study Desi cooking under my talented mother-in-law. She prepares food off-script; you have to watch her closely as she buzzes through the kitchen, or you miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build upon flavors and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by what I have learned cooking alongside her.

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Chicken: We use bone-in chicken thighs, but you can substitute boneless chicken thighs or chicken breasts if you prefer. If using chicken breasts, follow the suggested cooking time for this recipe, but be sure to cut the chicken into 1-inch pieces. If using boneless chicken thighs, reduce the cooking time to 20 minutes to prevent overcooked, rubbery chicken. 
-- The safe cooking temperature for chicken is 160 degrees. 

* Butter: We use high-quality butter, like Kerrygold, since butter is central to the dish; any butter should be fine. 

* Cream: I prefer using heavy cream because it blends well without being too temperamental. 

* Garam Masala: India is a vast country with varying sub-cultures, and as a result, Indian food differs from region to region. The same thing applies to specific spices used as well. For example, garam masala is a necessary ingredient for butter chicken, but each garam masala blend differs depending on its origin. For this reason, I suggest making garam masala at home, so you can control the amount of each spice used in the mix and cater it specifically to your preferences. If you choose to go the store-bought route, I suggest [Rani](https://amzn.to/3eqFSFa), Spice House, or Penzey's garam masala. 

* Tomatoes: I use fresh ingredients whenever possible, but you can also use canned, diced tomatoes. Just be sure to drain the contents in a colander before using them. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A heavy-bottomed pan 
* A food processor, blender, or immersion blender 

#### Can butter chicken be made vegetarian? Can butter chicken be made vegan? Can butter chicken be made dairy-free? 

This recipe caters well to a vegetarian, vegan, or dairy-free way of eating with a few modifications.  

* Vegetarian: Let's begin by finding a replacement for the chicken, shall we? I recommend using chickpeas, firm tofu, paneer, or roasted cauliflower. 

* Vegan: I prefer using chickpeas, firm tofu, or roasted cauliflower in place of the chicken. They come out delicious and hold up well throughout the cooking process. For added protein, you can also include toasted cashews. In place of butter, use either coconut oil or vegan butter, and you can use full-fat coconut milk as an alternative to the cream.

* Dairy-Free: In place of butter and cream, use coconut oil and coconut milk. 

For any non-meat substitutions, be sure to reduce the cooking time to 15 minutes. 

#### Is butter chicken keto or low-carb?
It is. We even calculated the macros for one chicken thigh and some of the sauce to make it easier for you.  

CARBS– 5 Net Carbs
PROTEIN– 26g
FAT–41g

 We recommend serving the butter chicken dish with a side of cauliflower rice or keto naan. 

#### Can I freeze butter chicken?

Yes, first allow the dish to cool completely and add it to a freezer-safe container. It will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it on the stovetop and prepare your sides.
