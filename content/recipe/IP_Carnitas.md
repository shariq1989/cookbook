#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Carnitas: 

* 2 tsp Salt 
* 1 tsp Ground Cumin 
* 1 tbsp Chipotle in Adobo (just the sauce, not the chilis)
* ½ tsp Black Pepper 
* 5 lb Pork Shoulder  
* 2 tbsp Avocado Oil 
* 1 tsp Ground Cinnamon
* 1 Large Red Onion, diced
* 3 Garlic Cloves
* 2 tsp Oregano 
* 1½ cup Orange Juice (no pulp)
* ½ cup Lime Juice, about 2-3 limes
* 1 Jalapeno, stems and seeds removed, diced 
* 2 Bay Leaves 
* 1 Cinnamon Stick 
* Liquid Smoke, to taste 

To Serve: 
* Corn Tortillas, warmed 
* 1 cup Cilantro, chopped 
* 1/2 Red Onion, chopped 
  
#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a small bowl, combine salt, cumin, ancho chili, and black pepper to create a rub. 
2. Remove skins and bones from the pork. Cut meat into 1-2 inch pieces. Massage the rub into the pork. 
3. Heat the oil on saute mode in an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ). Add the meat and let it cook until it begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Repeat until all the pork has had a chance to brown. Set aside. 
4. Place all of the meat back into the Instant Pot, along with the onion, garlic, jalapeno, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, orange juice, lime juice, and liquid smoke (2 taps). 
5. Secure the lid and cook on manual high pressure for 40 minutes and allow 20 minutes for natural release. 
6. Remove the pork from the Instant Pot using a slotted spoon and leaving the juices behind. Allow the meat to cool some before shredding it, and then spread it onto a rimmed baking sheet. 
7. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
8. Cover the meat with liquid smoke (to taste) and cook for 4 minutes or until you begin to see crispy bits, depending on your oven. The more crispy bits, the better. You may even want to move the meat around and repeat this process a few times based on your personal preference. 
9. Serve with warm corn tortillas and garnish with diced onions and cilantro.
