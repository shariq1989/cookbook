Servings: 4-6 <!--more-->

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 2- 14 oz can Chickpeas (Garbanzo Beans), drained and rinced 
* 1 Red Onion, finely chopped
* 3 Garlic Cloved, minced
* 1 inch Ginger, minced 
* 1 large Tomato, pureed in a food processor
* 1/2 cup Water 
* 2 tbsp Gree
* 1 tsp Turmeric Powder
* 2 tsp Kashmiri Chili Powder
* 1 tsp Garam Masala
* 1 tsp Coriander, ground 
* 1-3 Green Chili, split lengthwise 
* 1 tsp Cumin Seeds
* 1 tsp Kolongi Seeds (Black Mustard Seed) 
* 1/2 cup Cilantro, chopped 
* Salt, to taste

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Heat the ghee in a heavy bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the black mustard seed, cumin seed, and chilis until they begin to crackle.
2. Add the onion, stirring frequently, until onions begin to brown (not burned or charred). This step may take a while, that's okay. 
3. Add the garlic and ginger and stir to combine. 
4. In a small bowl, combine the coriander, chili powder, turmeric, and garam masala. Stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. 
5. Add the tomatoes puree and simmer, about 5 minutes.
6. Add the chickpeas and cilantro, along with 1/2 cup water, bring to a simmer. 
7. Cover with lid slightly ajar, and reduce heat to maintain a gentle bubbling. 
8. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has reduced into a thick stew, about 30 minutes.
9. Garnish with cilantro and serve with long-grain basmati rice or naan.
