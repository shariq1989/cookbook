### ABOUT THE MEAL

If you are craving biryani and don't have time to make it, try this quick and easy biryani recipe. It has all the flavor and brightness of the popular dish, but it cuts the preparation and cooking time in half. You can make this recipe on the stove-top or in the Instant Pot.

Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with Desi food. If you asked me the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry, I couldn’t have told you. Learning how to cook Indian food is something I treasure, especially since I have the honor of learning Desi cooking under my talented mother-in-law. She prepares food off-script, so you have to watch her closely as she buzzes through the kitchen, or you miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build upon flavors and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by what I have learned cooking alongside her.


#### Where does biryani originate? 

The word biryani derives from the Persian word “biran" which means, “fried before cooking." As such, historians believe the flavorful rice dish was born out of Persia. So how did this popular dish arrive in India? Biryani was introduced to Northern India by the Mughals- a group also credited for bringing pilau and kebabs; our family is forever grateful for that.

Like many well-known Indian dishes, biryani varies from region to region. Interestingly, this dish has a unique preparation in almost every area across the subcontinent. Some variations of biryani include: 
* Hyderabadi Dum Biryani
* Sindhi Biryani 
* Karachi Biryani
* Chettinad Biryani 
* Cutchi Biryani 
* Among others...

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Long-Grained Basmati Rice: Use [Authentic Basmati Rice](https://amzn.to/3cuai6I), or [Daawat Traditional Basmati Rice](https://amzn.to/2PSJxRL). The key to a quality rice dish is taking the time to soak it in water beforehand; the longer, the better. By taking this step, your rice will have the length and luxury you want from good biryani.

* Biryani Masala: I chose to make a quick and easy biryani masala using a combination of Kashmiri chili powder, garam masala, turmeric, salt, and Laziza Karahi Masala. You can also use a pre-made biryani masala like [Shan](https://amzn.to/3cGWNk9) to make the recipe even more manageable. 

* Chicken: I prefer to use bone-in chicken like thighs, legs, and quarters. If you favor boneless chicken, I suggest using thighs. There are also two ways to prepare biryani. You can make kachi biryani, which allows for the raw meat and rice to cook together as we have in this recipe. The other option would be to cook the meat beforehand and allow the cooked meat and rice to steam together. This method is called pakki biryani. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large serving bowl or [platter](https://amzn.to/3oc3X5q)
* An [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rJDIEg) 
* A [rice cooker](https://amzn.to/2OJpyED)

#### Can I make chicken biryani vegetarian? Can I make it vegan? 

I love biryani because the options for protein are endless. Some of the more common biryani's include boiled eggs, mixed vegetables, or a mixture of the two. If making a mixed vegetable biryani, I suggest using a combination of green beans, cauliflower, carrots, and peas. To make the biryani vegan, you will want to replace the yogurt and the ghee with something vegan-friendly. I suggest using coconut-based yogurt and vegan butter instead. 

#### Can I make chicken biryani non-dairy? 

The yogurt is used to tenderize the meat; you could use a coconut-based yogurt to achieve this or use tomatoes to achieve the same effect. 

#### Why do I separate the rice in this recipe? 

The rice at the bottom can end up a bit sticky while cooking in the Instant Pot. I counteract that by reserving a portion of rice that is light and fluffy to mix with it. If you are in a hurry, there is no need to separate the rice. Instead, add all of the rice, along with three cups of water to the Instant Pot before cooking. 

#### Can I freeze biryani?

Yes, allow the dish to cool completely, and then add it to a gallon Ziploc bag. The biryani will freeze for up to 2 months. When you're ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm up a single serving in the microwave or add it all to a pan for a quick and easy meal the whole family will enjoy.
