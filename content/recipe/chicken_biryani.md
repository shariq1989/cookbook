### How to Make Instant Pot Chicken Biriyani 

#### Ingredients 

For the Paste:

* 1/2 cup Full-Fat Yogurt 
* 2 tbsp Lemon Juice
* 2 tsp [Garam Masala](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/pakistani_garam_masala/) 
* 1 tbsp [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC)
* 1/2 tsp [Turmeric](https://amzn.to/3trObVj)
* 2 tsp Kosher Salt 
* 1 tbsp Laziza or Shan [Karahi Masala](https://amzn.to/2MYzcmx)
* 2 tbsp Garlic and Ginger Paste 
* 1/4 cup Cilantro, chopped, plus more for garnish
* 2 lb Chicken Thighs and Legs, bone-in and skinless 

For the Biryani: 

* 3 tbsp [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW) 
* 3 Red Onion, thinly sliced, divided
* 1 tbsp Cumin Seeds
* 5 [Green Cardomom](https://amzn.to/3vBa5aw)
* 1 [Star Anise](https://amzn.to/3eOVFhc)
* 2 Bay Leaves
* 2 tsp Kosher Salt 
* 3 cup Long-Grain Basmati Rice, pre-soaked and divided. 
* 3 1/2 cups Water, divided
* 2-3 Thai Green Chilis, to garnish  


#### Instructions 

1. Combine the ingredients for the paste in a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3dINXDE). Stir in the chicken and coat evenly. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. 
2. Wash the rice until water runs clear, and then soak it in water for 20 minutes. 
3. Warm 2 tbsp of ghee in the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) on saute mode. Add the onion and cook until they brown and caramelize. This process can take a while, and that's okay. You're building flavor for the dish. Remove half of the onion and set it aside. 
4. Next, add the cumin seed, green cardamom, and the star anise; cook until aromatic. 
5. Add the chicken and all of the remaining paste to [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ). Fry the mixture for about 3 minutes; stir frequently to prevent burning and sticking. 
6. Stir in the remaining ghee, salt, and add the bay leaves. Secure the lid and cook on manual high pressure for 4 minutes with quick release. 
7. Drain the soaked rice and add 1 cup to a [rice cooker](https://amzn.to/2OJpyED) or [saucepan](https://amzn.to/3rYQbXF) to cook separately. Add the remaining 2 cups of rice, salt, and 2 1/2 cups of water to the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) with the meat mixture. Secure the lid and cook on manual high pressure for 8 minutes with quick release. 
8. To plate, set out a serving bowl or  [platter](https://amzn.to/3oc3X5q). Layer the biryani mixture from the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) onto the bottom, followed by a layer of plain rice and a layer of reserved fried onions. Repeat this process with the remaining ingredients. 
9. Top with more fried onion, fresh cilantro, and green chilies. Serve with [raita](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/raita/), and enjoy.

### About the Biryani 

Making traditional biryani involves a wonderfully long and intricate process of layering meat or vegetables, rice, and tempting aromatics. Surely if you've tasted biryani, it is now something you crave from time to time. Treat yourself to the same mouth-watering taste of biryani without setting aside most of your day to make it. This quick chicken biryani recipe is easy to make and has the traditional Pakistani and Indian flavors associated with biryani, but my recipe cuts the preparation and cooking time in half. I hope my Instant Pot chicken biryani fits into your busy schedule and satisfies your cravings.

#### Where does biryani originate? 

The word biryani derives from the Persian word “biran" which means, “fried before cooking." Historians believe the flavorful rice dish was born out of Persia. So how did this popular dish arrive in India and Pakistan? Biryani was introduced to Northern India by the Mughals- a group also credited for bringing pulao and kebabs; our family is forever grateful for that.

Like many well-known Indian and Pakistani dishes, biryani varies from region to region; this dish has a unique preparation in every area across the subcontinent. Some variations of biryani include: 
* Hyderabadi Dum Biryani
* Sindhi Biryani 
* Karachi Biryani
* Chettinad Biryani 
* Cutchi Biryani 
* Among others...

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Full-Fat Yogurt 

* Lemon Juice

* [Garam Masala](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/pakistani_garam_masala/) 

* [Kashmiri Chili Powder](https://amzn.to/3jP2lMC)

* [Turmeric](https://amzn.to/3trObVj)

* Laziza or Shan [Karahi Masala](https://amzn.to/2MYzcmx)

* Garlic and Ginger Paste 

* Cilantro

* Chicken: I use bone-in chicken like thighs, legs, and quarters. If you favor boneless chicken, I suggest using thighs. There are also two ways to prepare meat in biryani. You can make kachi biryani, in which the raw meat and rice to cook together. The other option would be to cook the meat separately beforehand and allow the cooked meat and rice to steam together. This method is called pakki biryani. 

* [Ghee](https://amzn.to/2ZkJkrW) 

* Red Onion

* Cumin Seeds

* [Green Cardomom](https://amzn.to/3vBa5aw)

* [Star Anise](https://amzn.to/3eOVFhc)

* Bay Leaves

* Kosher Salt 

* Long-Grained Basmati Rice: Use [Authentic Basmati Rice](https://amzn.to/3cuai6I), or [Daawat Traditional Basmati Rice](https://amzn.to/2PSJxRL). The key to a quality rice dish is setting aside time to soak it in water beforehand; the longer, the better! In reserving time for this step, your rice will have the length and luxury you desire from good biryani. A note on color: If you enjoy the bright coloring of restaurant-style biryani, you can add food coloring to the plain rice to create brightness if you choose. 

* Thai Green Chilis

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3dINXDE)
* An [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rJDIEg) 
* A [rice cooker](https://amzn.to/2OJpyED) or [saucepan](https://amzn.to/3rYQbXF)
* A large serving bowl or [platter](https://amzn.to/3oc3X5q)

#### Can I make chicken biryani vegetarian? Can I make it vegan? 

I love biryani for many reasons, but especially because the options for protein are endless. Some of the more common biryani dishes include boiled eggs, mixed vegetables, or a combination of the two. If making a mixed vegetable biryani, I suggest green beans, cauliflower, carrots, and peas. To make your biryani vegan, you will want to replace the yogurt and the ghee with something vegan-friendly. I suggest using coconut-based yogurt and vegan butter instead. 

#### Can I make chicken biryani non-dairy? 

The yogurt tenderizes the meat; you could use a coconut-based yogurt to achieve the same or use tomatoes instead. 

#### Why do I separate the rice in this recipe? 

Cooking biryani in the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rJDIEg) often results in sticky rice at the bottom of the pan. I attempt to counteract this by reserving a portion of rice that is light and fluffy to incorporate with it. 

If you are in a hurry, skip separating the rice. Instead, add all of the rice, along with three cups of water to the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rJDIEg) before cooking. 

#### Can I freeze biryani?

You sure can. First, allow the dish to cool completely. Then, add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. Biryani will freeze for up to 2 months. When you're ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm up a single serving in the microwave or add it all to a covered saute pan for a quick and easy meal the whole family will enjoy.
