Servings: 8-10 Granola Bars  <!--more-->

Preparation Time: 10 minutes 

Chilling Time: 1 hour 


#### INGREDIENTS 

 * 1 cup Cashews 
 * 1 cup Almonds 
 * 2 tbsp Chia Seeds 
 * 2 tbsp Flax Seeds 
 * 1 cup Coconut Chips 
 * 1 cup Craisins
 * 1 tsp Cinnamon 
 * 1/4 cup Coconut Oil 
 * 1/4 cup Honey 
 * 1/4 cup Almond Butter 
 * 1 tsp Vanilla Extract 


#### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Place the cashews and almonds in a food processor and pulse a few times. You don't want to over-mix and create a flour-like texture; chunkier bits are just fine. 
2. Move the mixture to a large bowl and stir in the chia seeds, flax seeds, coconut chips, craisins, and ground cinnamon until combined. Set aside. 
3. In a small saute pan, warm the coconut oil and then whisk in the honey and almond butter until smooth. Off heat, add in the vanilla extract. 
4. Pour the mixture over the dry ingredients and combine the two using a silicone spatula. Set the mixture aside to cool for about 5 minutes, and then gently add the chocolate chips. If you add the chocolate chips before the mixture has had a chance to cool, they will melt on you. 
5. Line an 8 x 8 pan with parchment paper. It's helpful if the parchment paper comes up over the sides for easy removal.
6. Transfer the mixture to the pan and pack it using a spatula or another piece of parchment paper. You want it packed in tight so that the bars have a better chance of staying together. 
7. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and place it in the freezer for 1 hour.
8. Remove the pan from the freezer and grab opposing ends of the parchment paper to remove the bars and transfer them to a cutting board.
9. Use a knife to cut the mixture into bars. 


### ABOUT THE SNACK

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Nuts: We use almonds and cashews because that is what we usually have on hand. Walnuts or pecans would be a great addition to these bars as well, but we avoid them in our home since I am allergic. 

* Seeds: I love the addition of chia seeds and flaxseeds to this granola bar for texture, but also their healthy fat. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A food processor 
* A large bowl 
* A small saute pan 
* An 8 x 8 baking pan and parchment paper 

#### How should I store the granola bars?

Because we use coconut oil as a binding for the granola bars, they melt if left at room temperature. To store, keep them chilled in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.
