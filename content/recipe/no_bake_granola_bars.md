### How to Make No-Bake Paleo Granola Bars 

#### INGREDIENTS 

 * 1 cup Cashews 
 * 1 cup Almonds 
 * 2 tbsp Chia Seeds 
 * 2 tbsp Flax Seeds 
 * 1 cup Coconut Flakes 
 * 1 cup Craisins
 * 1 tsp Cinnamon 
 * 1/4 cup Coconut Oil 
 * 1/4 cup Honey 
 * 1/4 cup [Almond Butter](https://amzn.to/3ljxdqJ) 
 * 1 tsp [Vanilla Extract](https://amzn.to/3xPaWpX) 

#### INSTRUCTION

1. Place the cashews and almonds in a [food processor](https://amzn.to/32jLA7Q) and pulse a few times to break them up. You don't want to over-mix and create a flour-like texture.
2. Fill a small bowl with warm water and add the craisins. Let them sit for about 5 minutes until they soften and rehydrate. 
3. Move the mixture from the [food processor](https://amzn.to/32jLA7Q) to a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3CFijkm) and stir in chia seeds, flax seeds, coconut flakes, soaked craisins, and ground cinnamon until combined. Set aside. 
4. In a [saute pan](https://amzn.to/3nC6gjK), warm coconut oil and then whisk in the honey and almond butter until smooth. Off heat, stir in the vanilla extract. 
5. Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients and combine the two using a [silicone spatula](https://amzn.to/3ctiG77). Then gently fold in the chocolate chips. 
6. Line a [baking pan](https://amzn.to/3FA9RVk) with parchment paper. It's helpful if the parchment paper comes up and over the sides for easy removal later on.
7. Transfer the mixture to the pan and pack it down using a spatula or another piece of parchment paper. You want it packed tight so that the bars have a better chance of staying together once you have sliced them. 
8. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and set it in the freezer for 1 hour.
9. Remove the pan from the freezer and grab opposing ends of the parchment paper to remove the bars. Transfer them to a cutting board.
10. Use a sharp knife to cut the mixture into bars. You can do squares or rods, whichever you prefer.

### ABOUT THE SNACK

#### What ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Cashews and Almonds: We use almonds and cashews because that is what we usually have on hand. Walnuts or pecans would be a great addition to these bars, but I avoid them since I am allergic.  

* Chia Seeds and Flax Seeds: I love the addition of chia seeds and flaxseeds for extra texture, but also because of the healthy fat they lend to the bar. 

* Coconut Flakes 

* Craisins

* Cinnamon 

* Coconut Oil 

* Honey

* [Almond Butter](https://amzn.to/3ljxdqJ) 

* [Vanilla Extract](https://amzn.to/3xPaWpX) 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [food processor](https://amzn.to/32jLA7Q) 
* A small bowl
* [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3CFijkm)
* A [saute pan](https://amzn.to/3nC6gjK)
* A [silicone spatula](https://amzn.to/3ctiG77)

#### How should I store the granola bars?

Because coconut oil is a main ingredient, the bars will melt if left at room temperature. To store, keep them chilled in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.
