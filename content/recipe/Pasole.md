* 1-2 Guajillo Chilis, dried
* 2½ lb Pork Butt, cut into 1-inch pieces 
* 1 large White Onion, diced

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Heat oil in an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) on saute mode until it begins to smoke. 
2. Add a layer of pork to the bottom of the pan and let it brown, 3-4 minutes. Repeat this until all the meat has had a chance to brown. Set aside. 
3. Next, add the onions to the Instant Pot and cook until they become translucent and soften. 
4. Combine the remaining ingredients into the Instant Pot, along with the meat. Seal the lid and cook on high pressure for 50 minutes with a quick release. (This cooking time is for high-elevation. Reduce the cooking time for lower elevation). 
5. Serve with radishes, cabbage, cilantro, lime wedges, avocado, chili flakes, and oregano.    

#### ABOUT THE MEAL 

#### Is pasole vegetarian? Is pasole vegan?

My sisters are vegetarian so more often than not, that is how we choose to make it. Here are some adjustments you can make to this recipe in order to make it both vegetarian and vegan friendly. 

* Instead of Chicken Better than Bouillion, use [Vegetable Better than Bouillion](https://amzn.to/3dZTYx1)
* In place of meat, we double the hominy and use 2- 29 oz cans.
