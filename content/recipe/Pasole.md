#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Pasole: 

* 1 tsp Cumin, ground 
* 1 tbsp Oregano
* 2 Bay Leaves 
* 1 tbsp Avocado Oil 
* ½ can Chipotle in Adobo Sauce 
* 1-2 Guajillo Chilis, dried
* 2½ lb Pork Butt, cut into 1-inch pieces 
* 1 large White Onion, diced 
* 6 Garlic Cloves, minced 
* 4 cup of Water and 2 tbsp [Chicken Better Than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/3uFvZt3) 
* 1-29 oz can of Hominy, drained and rinsed 

To Serve: 

* Radishes, thinly sliced
* Cabbage, shredded     
* Cilantro, chopped  
* Lime Wedges 
* Avocado, cubed 
* Chili Flakes 
* Oregano 
  
#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Heat the oil in an [Instant Pot]( on saute mode until it begins to smoke. 
2. Add a layer of pork to the bottom of the pan and let it brown, 3-4 minutes. Repeat this until all the meat has had a chance to brown. Set aside. 
3. Next, add the onions to the Instant Pot and cook until they become translucent and soften. 
4. Combine the remaining ingredients into the Instant Pot, along with the meat. Seal the lid and cook on high pressure for 50 minutes with a quick release. (This cooking time is for high-elevation. Reduce the cooking time for lower elevation). 
5. Serve with radishes, cabbage, cilantro, lime wedges, avocado, chili flakes, and oregano.    

#### ABOUT THE MEAL 

My family makes pasole pretty much any time we are together as a family. Since my sisters are vegetarian, that is how we choose to make it. Here are some adjustments you can make to this recipe in order to make it vegetarian-friendly. 
1. Replace the Chicken Better than Bouillon with [Vegetable Better than Bouillion](https://amzn.to/3dZTYx1)
2. Double the hominy.
