#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Heat the oil in the Instant Pot or pressure cooker on saute mode until it begins to smoke. 
2. Add a layer of pork to the bottom of the pan and let it brown, 3-4 minutes. Repeat this until all the meat has had a chance to brown. Set aside. 
3. Add the onions to the Instant Pot and cook until they become translucent and soften. 
4. Combine the remaining ingredients and add them to the pot along with the meat. Cook on high pressure for 50 minutes with a quick release. (This cooking time is for high-elevation. Reduce the cooking time for lower elevation). 
5. Garnish with radishes, cabbage, cilantro, lime wedges, avocado, chili flakes, and oregano.
