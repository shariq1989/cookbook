#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Warm oil in an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) on saute mode until it begins to smoke. 
2. Add the pork to the Instant Pot in a single layer and let it brown, 3-4 minutes. Repeat this until all the made has had a chance to brown. Set aside. 
3. Next, add the onions to the Instant Pot and cook until they become translucent and soften. 
4. Combine the remaining ingredients into the Instant Pot, along with the meat. Stir the mixture to combine and then seal the lid. Cook on manual high pressure for 50 minutes with a quick release. This cooking time is for high-elevation. Reduce the cooking time for lower elevation. 
5. Serve with radishes, cabbage, cilantro, lime wedges, avocado, chili flakes, and oregano.

#### Is pasole vegetarian? Is pasole vegan?

My sisters are vegetarian, so that's how we often choose to make it. Here are some adjustments you can make to this recipe to make it vegetarian and vegan-friendly. 

* Instead of Chicken Better than Bouillion, use [Vegetable Better than Bouillion](https://amzn.to/3dZTYx1)

* In place of meat, we double the hominy, using 2 - 29 oz cans.
