#### INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Warm oil in an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) on saute mode until it begins to smoke. 
2. Add the pork to the Instant Pot in a single layer and let it brown, 3-4 minutes. Repeat this until all the made has had a chance to brown. Set aside. 
3. Next, add the onions to the Instant Pot and cook until they become translucent and soften. 
4. Combine the remaining ingredients into the Instant Pot, along with the meat. Stir the mixture to combine and then seal the lid. Cook on manual high pressure for 50 minutes with a quick release. This cooking time is for high-elevation. Reduce the cooking time for lower elevation.

#### ABOUT THE MEAL 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Pork Shoulder

* Hominy: I use canned hominy to make the process easier, but if you want to use dried hominy, you will have to set aside extra time to prepare it.

* Chilis: For this recipe, I use canned chilis en adobo and dried guajillo chilis

* Garnish: Pazole is all about the garnishes; you make the stew your own with a choice of toppings. Here are some of the most common: radishes, red onion, cabbage, cilantro, lime wedges, avocado, chili flakes, and oregano.  

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* An [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3taIo6v)

#### Is pozole vegetarian? Is it vegan?

I often prepare my pozole with just hominy since my sisters are all vegetarian. Here are some adjustments you can make to this recipe to make it vegetarian and vegan-friendly. 

* Instead of Chicken Better than Bouillion, use [Vegetable Better than Bouillion](https://amzn.to/3dZTYx1)

* In place of meat, we double the hominy, using 2 - 29 oz cans instead.   

#### Can I freeze Pozole? 

Yes, first allow the dish to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container. Pozole Rojo can freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm the soup on a stovetop, prepare your toppings, and enjoy!

Note: Normally, I cut the pork into pieces, but for this example, I was cooking a small batch using meat leftover on a pork shoulder bone.
