### How to Make BBQ Chicken Drumsticks 

#### Ingredients  

For the BBQ Rub: 

* 2 tbsp Brown Sugar
* 1 tbsp Paprika
* 1 tbsp Red Chili Powder
* 2 tsp Garlic Powder
* 1/2 tsp Kosher Salt
* 1/2 tsp Pepper
* 1/4 tsp Cayenne Pepper

For the BBQ Chicken: 

* 8 Chicken Drumsticks, skin on, and bone-in
* BBQ Sauce of your choice, we like [Sweet Baby Rays](https://amzn.to/2NsxauJ) or the [sugar-free](https://amzn.to/2MYvhWR) version

#### Oven Instructions

* Cook Time: 40 minutes 

1. In a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3o4ml1T), add the spices for the rub and massage them into the drumsticks. Cover the bowl and marinate them in the fridge for 6 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and then set a [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3AQLn8k) into a [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3COm9rS); line the drumsticks onto it.
3. Cook for 25-30 minutes, flipping the drumsticks halfway through.
4. Brush them with bbq sauce and cook them for 3 minutes, sauce side down. 
5. Brush the other side with bbq sauce, and cook for another 2 minutes.  
6. Remove the drumsticks from heat and let them rest for about 5 minutes before serving.

#### Grill Instructions  

* Cook Time: 1 hour, 10 minutes

1. In a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3o4ml1T), add the spices for the rub and massage them into the drumsticks. Cover the bowl and marinate them in the fridge for 6 hours.
2. Pre-heat the grill by setting all the burners to high heat, about 10 minutes.
3. Turn off the rightmost burner, but maintain a grill temperature of 350 degrees. Adjust the temperature accordingly.
4. Oil the grates and cook the drumsticks on the hottest side of the grill. Cook until they become blistered, about 5 minutes. I check them halfway through to prevent burning. 
5. Flip the drumsticks and cook for another 5 minutes to establish blistering on the other side. Again, check them halfway through. 
6. Move the drumsticks to the cool side of the grill, the rightmost burner you turned off, and cook them for 25 minutes. Check throughout to make sure the grill temperature maintains at 350 degrees. 
7. Flip the drumsticks; continue cooking until they have reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees, about 20-30 minutes.
8. Brush the drumsticks with bbq sauce and move them, sauce side down, to the hot side of the grill; cook for 1 minute. 
9. Brush the other side with bbq sauce, and cook on the same side for another minute.  
10. Remove the drumsticks from heat and let them rest for 5 minutes before serving.

### About the Meal

We love get-togethers with family and friends, and these BBQ chicken drumsticks are a perfect addition to any cookout, picnic, or backyard gathering. I prepare them with a homemade rub, and they are made in the oven or on the grill for moist and juicy drumsticks every time. I hope you enjoy this recipe for BBQ chicken drumsticks.

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* BBQ Rub: I use a homemade rub in this recipe. I will often double or triple the batch and store the rub into an airtight container, like a mason jar, to have some on hand. BBQ rub will keep this way for up to 3 months. If you prefer store-bought, I recommend [Montreal's](https://amzn.to/2QOX1P8) mixed with a bit of brown sugar, about 2 tbsp.

* Chicken Drumsticks: You can grill any part of the chicken- breast or thighs, but I love using drumsticks. They are easy to eat and universally well-liked. Bonus, our kids devour them. 

* BBQ Sauce: I am sure there are many tasty BBQ sauces out there I don't know about, but our family go-to is [Sweet Baby Ray's](https://amzn.to/2NsxauJ). This brand is always delicious, and they offer [sugar-free](https://amzn.to/2MYvhWR), which makes everyone in the family happy. 


#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3o4ml1T) 

* 2 [rimmed baking sheets](https://amzn.to/3COm9rS)

*  A [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3AQLn8k)

#### Are BBQ chicken drumsticks keto? Are BBQ Chicken Drumsticks low-carb?

They are!! Use sugar-free [bbq sauce](https://amzn.to/2MYvhWR) of your choice and replace the brown sugar in the rub with [Swerve](https://amzn.to/39rvQQS) brown sugar replacement. I calculated the macros for one serving of the BBQ drumsticks to make it easy for you. The serving size is two drumsticks. 

For the Drumsticks with Rub (Swerve replacement included): 

* CARBS– 1 Net Carb
* PROTEIN– 55g
* FAT– 13g

For the BBQ Sauce- 2 tbsp: 

* CARBS– 1 Net Carb 

#### Can I freeze chicken drumsticks?

You sure can. First, allow the drumsticks to cool completely. Then, wrap them in foil, and add them to a freezer-safe container or bag. The BBQ drumsticks will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let them defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm them in the oven.
