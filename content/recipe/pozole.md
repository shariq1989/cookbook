#### ABOUT THE MEAL 

Authentic Mexican pozole rojo is a rich stew often made with pork, hominy, and a variety of chilis that flavor the broth. I hope you enjoy this pozole recipe our family loves.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Pork Shoulder

* Hominy: I use canned hominy, but if you want to use dried hominy, you need to set aside extra time to prepare it.

* Chilis: For this recipe, I use canned [chipotle in adobo sauce](https://amzn.to/2OIJBTR) and dried guajillo chilis

* Garnish: Pozole is all about the garnish, at least for me; you get to make the stew your own with a variety of toppings. I usually garnish with radishes, red onion, cabbage, cilantro, lime wedges, avocado, chili flakes, and Mexican oregano.  

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* An [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3taIo6v)

#### Can I make a vegetarian Pozole? Vegan Pozole?

I make pozole for many of our holiday meals, and I often prepare this pozole recipe with hominy as the main ingredient since my sister is a vegetarian. Here are some adjustments you can make to this recipe to make it vegetarian and vegan-friendly. 

* Instead of Chicken Better than Bouillion, use [Vegetable Better than Bouillion](https://amzn.to/3dZTYx1)

* In place of meat, double the hominy, using 2 - 29 oz cans instead.   

#### Can I freeze Pozole? 

Yes, first allow the dish to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe bag or container. Pozole can freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm the stew on the stovetop, prepare your toppings, and enjoy!
