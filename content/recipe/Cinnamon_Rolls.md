#### INGREDIENTS

For the Cinnamon Rolls: 
* 2 1/2 cups All Purpose Flour, plus more for rolling the dough
* 3 tbsp White Granulated Sugar
* 1 1/4 tsp Baking Powder 
* 1/2 tsp Baking Soda 
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 1 1/4 cup Buttermilk 
* 6 tbsp Butter, melted


For the Filling:
* 1/2 cup Brown Sugar, packed
* 3 tsp Cinnamon, ground
* 1/8 tsp Salt
* 1/4 cup White Granulated Sugar

For the Frosting:
* 1 cup Powdered Sugar 
* 2 tbsp Butter, softened
* 1 tsp Vanilla
* 1 tbsp Milk 

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degress and combine the ingredients for the filling in a small bowl. Mix well and set aside. 
2. In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside. 
3. Whisk the buttermilk and melted butter in a separate bowl and then pour it into the middle of the dry ingredients. Stir together until dough comes together. Do not overmix. Kneed the dough slightly until the dough forms into a ball, then slice it in half.
4. On a lightly floured surface, roll each half into a 12x8" rectangle (think slightly longer than a sheet of paper.) Press half the filling mixture into the center, leaving 1/4" of the dough clear on all 4 sides, then roll like a sausage. Pinch together seam, trim ends and cut into 8 slices. Repeat with the other dough half, then place rolls in a non-stick sprayed 11x8" pan, or an 8x8 and 6x4" pan. Brush cinnamon rolls with remaining Tablespoon of melted butter and bake for 15 minutes, or until tops are golden brown.
5. Meanwhile, to make the icing, mash together softened cream cheese and powdered sugar with a fork until smooth. Whisk in buttermilk, 1 Tablespoon at a time, until creamy. Drizzle onto hot cinnamon rolls and spread evenly.


### ABOUT THE CINNAMON ROLLS 

You can't beat a warm batch of cinnamon rolls, and during the first round of Covid quarantine, we were craving that little bit of comfort in our home. The only problem, we couldn't find yeast anywhere; we had to find a way to make cinnamon rolls without it. 

With this recipe, you still get all the yummy goodness of cinnamon rolls, but without the prepping and proofing that comes from using yeast to make your dough. By omitting the yeast from the recipe and replacing it with baking powder, it decreases the preparation time, meaning you can get the cinnamon rolls to the table even quicker.
