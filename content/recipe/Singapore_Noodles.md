#### INGREDIENTS 

* ¼ lb. Shrimp, shelled, deveined, and rinsed under cold water
* 2 tbsp, plus 4 tsp Canola Oil, divided
* 2½ tsp [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/3jMYZdj), divided
* 1 bundle Rice Stick Noodles 
* 2 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 1 tsp Soy Sauce
* 1 tsp Rice Wine Vinegar
* ¼ tsp Sugar
* 2 Eggs, beaten with two pinches Kosher Salt
* ½ medium White Onion, very thinly sliced
* ½ medium Red Bell Pepper, stemmed, seeded, very thinly sliced
* 12 Snow Peas, stemmed, tough strings removed, and thinly sliced
* ½ medium Carrot, thinly sliced
* 2 tbsp [Yellow Curry Powder](https://amzn.to/3rTXdcZ), divided
* Kosher Salt, to taste 
* 2 Scallions, greens thinly sliced
* 2 tsp Toasted Sesame Oil

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Pat the shrimp dry and place them into a small bowl. Add 1 tsp canola oil and 1/2 tsp fish sauce. Mix well and refrigerate.
2. Place rice noodles into a large bowl and cover with boiling water. Let stand for 5 minutes. Drain noodles in a colander and rinse with cold running water, then drain until dry. Using scissors, cut the bundle of noodles in half.
3. Combine the garlic, soy sauce, rice wine, sugar, and remaining 2 tsp fish sauce. Mix well and set aside.
4. Heat 1 tsp canola oil in a wok or a nonstick skillet over high heat, tilting to swirl oil, until smoking. Add the eggs and let them cook undisturbed for about 10 seconds. Gently move the eggs back and forth with a spatula until they firm up. Break the eggs into small pieces and set them aside. 
5. Wipe the pan clean and return to high heat, add 2 tsp oil, and warm until smoking. Add shrimp and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add onion and continue to stir-fry for another 30 seconds. Add red bell pepper and snow peas and stir for another 30 seconds, then add carrots. 
6. Add 1 tsp curry powder and salt. Cook, tossing until curry is evenly distributed. Scrape the pan contents into the bowl with the reserved eggs.
7. Wipe the pan clean again. Heat the remaining 2 tbsp canola oil over high heat until smoking. Add the rice-stick noodles and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the sauce mixture and the remaining 2 tsp of curry powder. Stir until evenly distributed. 
8. Return the egg, shrimp, and vegetables to the pan and stir-fry until everything is evenly combined, about 30 seconds. Season with salt, to taste, and remove from heat. 
9. Garnish with scallions and drizzle with sesame oil to serve. 

#### ABOUT THE MEAL 

It's not entirely clear where Singapore noodles originate, but many sources say Hong Kong, despite its name. Regardless, what I love about this dish is that the flavors have been heavily influenced by so many people groups: The Cantonese and British, as well as the Chinese-Indo cuisine made popular in Singapore. 

This is another dish we tried at a restaurant for the first time and decided we needed to find a way to make it at home. While the traditional dish includes flavorful fried fried pork, we remove it from our recipe so that my husband's parents could enjoy the dish with us. Feel free to add fried pork to yours if you want a version of this dish that is closer to the way it is made in other countries.
