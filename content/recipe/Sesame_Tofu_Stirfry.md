Cuisine: Chinese, American

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1/2 package Firm Tofu, cut into small pieces (see the picture below) 
* 1 package Shiitake Mushrooms, sliced 
* 8 Scallions, whites and greens separated- whites, cut in 1-inch pieces- greend, thinly sliced 
* 3 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 2-5 [Arbol Chilis](https://amzn.to/3c4M7M9), dried, depending on your desired spice
* 4 tbsp Sesame Oil
* 3 tbsp Soy Sauce 
* 1 tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar 
* 1 tsp [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/3sDAu5f), If making vegan, use [Marmite](https://amzn.to/2Ovg8wi) 
* 1 tsp Honey 
* 1 cup Water 
* ½ tsp Flour 
* ¼ tsp Black Pepper, coarse ground 
* ¼ tsp Toasted Sesame Seeds   

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and lightly oil a rimmed sheet pan. 
2. Prepare the tofu by patting it dry with a cloth to remove as much moisture as possible. Cut the tofu into bite-size cubes and lightly season with salt and pepper. 
3. Spread out the tofu onto the rimmed baking sheet and cook for 15 minutes, turning the tofu pieces midway to bake thoroughly.
4. In a large skillet, warm sesame oil over medium-high heat and add the already baked tofu to a hot pan. Fry until the pieces become golden brown. Set aside. 
5. Using the same oil (add more if needed), add the chilis, scallion whites, and garlic. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
6. In a small bowl, mix the soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, fish oil, honey, and water to the pan. Stir until the honey dissolves. Off heat, add these ingredients to the pan, and season with black pepper. 
7. Return the pan to medium-high heat and bring the mixture to a boil and then whisk in the flour. Use the whisk to scrape up any bits of fried tofu left behind. 
8. Add the mushrooms, stir to combine, and then turn the heat down. Simmer until sauce reduces halfway, about 5 minutes. 
9. Return the tofu to the pan and combine with the other ingredients, about 2-3 minutes.
10. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and scallion greens and serve with jasmine rice. 

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

My sister, a fabulous cook, made a similar dish for us after our first child. We loved it so much; we decided to make our own. 

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Firm Tofu: I prefer using firm tofu because it holds up well during the baking and frying process. 

* Shiitake Mushrooms: I love sliced shiitake mushrooms because they absorb the flavors in this recipe well. We often add other mushrooms when making this meal, but the shiitakes are tried and true. 

* Sesame Flavor: We introduce the sesame flavor in two ways: the sesame oil and sesame seeds

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A rimmed baking sheet 
* A large skillet 
* A small bowl

#### Is Sesame Mushroom and Tofu Stir-Fry vegetarian? Is Sesame Mushroom and Tofu Stir-Fry vegan?

This dish caters to both a vegetarian and vegan way of eating. Easily replace the fish sauce in the recipe with marmite instead; the marmite adds the umami flavor we are going for with the fish sauce.  You can also substitute the honey in the recipe for agave. 

#### Can I freeze the tofu stir-fry?

While you can freeze uncooked or fried firm tofu, I wouldn't suggest freezing stir-fried tofu, especially if cooked in a sauce; freezing and re-heating will alter the desired texture of the tofu.
