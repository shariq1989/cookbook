Servings: 4-5<!--more-->

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 package Firm Tofu 
* 1 package of Mushroom of your choice, quartered 
* 8 Scallions, sliced, whites and greens seperated
* 3 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 2-5 Arbol Chilis, dried
* 4 tbsp Sesame Oil
* 3 tbsp Soy Sauce 
* 1 tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar 
* 1 tsp Fish Oil, use Marmite if making vegan  
* 1 tsp Honey 
* 1 cup Water 
* ½ tsp Flour 
* ¼ tsp Pepper, ground 
* ¼ tsp Toasted Sesame Seeds   

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and lightly oil a rimmed sheet pan. 
2. Prepare the tofu, pat it dry with a cloth to remove as much moisture as possible. 
3. Cut tofu into bite size cubes and lightly season with salt and pepper. 
4. Spread out the tofu onto the rimmed baking sheet and cook for 15-20 minutes, turning tofu pieces midway to cook thoroughly. Cook until lightly browned. 
5. In a large skillet, warm sesame oil over medium heat and add the already baked tofu. Fry until golden brown. Set aside. 
6. Using the same oil, add more if needed, add the chilis, scallion whites, and garlic. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
8. Off heat, add in the soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, fish oil (marmite), water, and pepper to the pan. Bring to a boil and then whisk in the flour. Use the whisk to scrape up any bits of tofu left behind from frying. 
9. Add the mushrooms, stir to combine, and turn the heat down. Simmer until sauce reduces halfway. 
10. Return the tofu to the pan and let it combine with the other ingredients, about 2-3 minutes.
11. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and scallions and serve with jasmine rice or quinoa.
