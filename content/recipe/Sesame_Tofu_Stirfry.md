#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 package Firm Tofu 
* 1 package Mushroom of your choice, quartered 
* 8 Scallions, sliced, whites and greens separated
* 3 Garlic Cloves, minced
* 2-5 Arbol Chilis, dried, depending on your desired spice
* 4 tbsp Sesame Oil
* 3 tbsp Soy Sauce 
* 1 tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar 
* 1 tsp [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/3sDAu5f), If making vegan, use [Marmite](https://amzn.to/2Ovg8wi) 
* 1 tsp Honey 
* 1 cup Water 
* ½ tsp Flour 
* ¼ tsp Pepper, ground 
* ¼ tsp Toasted Sesame Seeds   

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and lightly oil a rimmed sheet pan. 
2. Prepare the tofu by patting it dry with a cloth to remove as much moisture as possible. 
3. Cut the tofu into bite-size cubes and lightly season with salt and pepper. 
4. Spread out the tofu onto the rimmed baking sheet and cook for 15-20 minutes, turning the tofu pieces midway to cook thoroughly.
5. In a large skillet, warm sesame oil over medium heat and add the already baked tofu. Fry until the pieces become golden brown. Set aside. 
6. Using the same oil (add more if needed), add the chilis, scallion whites, and garlic. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
7. Off heat, add the soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, fish oil, water, and pepper to the pan. Bring to a boil and then whisk in the flour. Use the whisk to scrape up any bits of fried tofu that were left behind. 
8. Add the mushrooms, stir to combine, and then turn the heat down. Simmer until sauce reduces halfway. 
9. Return the tofu to the pan and let it combine with the other ingredients, about 2-3 minutes.
10. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and scallion greens and serve with jasmine rice or quinoa. 

#### ABOUT THE MEAL 

My sister, who is a fabulous cook, made a similar dish for us after we had our first child. We loved it so much, we decided to make our own. Originally made to be meatless and vegetarian, this dish could easily be made vegan by simply replacing the fish sauce with marmite; this still adds the umami flavor we are going for.
