### How to make Nutella and Peanut Butter Cookies

#### Ingredients 

* 1 cup White Sugar
* 1 cup Brown Sugar
* 1 cup Butter, softened
* 2/3 cup Peanut Butter 
* 2 tsp [Vanilla Extract](https://amzn.to/3o3rAPj)
* 2 Eggs
* 2 2/3 cups Flour, All-Purpose 
* 2 tsp Baking Soda
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 1/2 tsp Baking Powder
* 1/2 cup [Nutella](https://amzn.to/3vgU75p)

#### Instructions 

1. In a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3D2NC8M), combine the white and brown sugar. Then, use a [hand mixer](https://amzn.to/3bB2G3c) to blend the butter and peanut butter into the sugar until creamy.  
2. Stir in the vanilla extract and beat one egg at a time into the mixture. Set aside. 
3. In another [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3D2NC8M), whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder. Then, add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients. Blend until fully incorporated. 
4. Add 2-3 dollops of Nutella to the dough, fold it in gently, and then add 2-3 more dallops before folding it again. Then use a knife to swirl the Nutella into the dough. 
5. Cover the dough and place it in the fridge for 30 minutes. 
6. Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees. 
7. Drop spoonfuls of dough onto a [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3vhinF4) and bake for 15 minutes. This cooking time is for higher elevation, but you can reduce the cooking time to 10 minutes for lower elevation.

### About the Cookies  

I have always loved cooking and baking, but I haven't always been great at it- especially baking. Back in the day, I wanted so badly to bake something people wanted to eat, but my attempts always ended with barely edible creations. Then something incredible happened, the invention of Pinterest. While searching one day, I stumbled upon a Nutella cookie recipe; I was determined to master it. My poor mom and sisters ate cookies for a week straight as I experimented with their recipe to transform it into something tasty. Finally, with a few adjustments for higher elevation (I didn't realize this was the issue for far too long) and the addition of peanut butter, this recipe was born. I hope you enjoy these Nutella and Peanute Butter cookies our family loves.

#### Can I freeze cookie dough? 

You sure can. Roll the dough into one large ball and place it into a freezer-safe bag. Clear any air out of the bag before securing it. The cookie dough will freeze for up to 3 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, follow the baking instructions in the recipe.
