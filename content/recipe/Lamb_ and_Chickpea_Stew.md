#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a bowl, stir together paprika, cumin, cardamom, cinnamon, 2 tsp salt and 1 tsp. pepper. Reserve half of the spice mixture, then massage the beef with the rest of the mixture. Set aside. 
2. Cut off and discard the top third of the garlic head, leaving the head intact. 
3. In a large dutch oven, over medium high, melt the butter. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until they become translucent and soften, 5 to 8 minutes.
4. Add tomato paste and the reserved spice mixture. Cook, stirring constantly for 1 minute. Add the water and bring to a boil over high heat, then add the beef and garlic head, cut side down. 
5. Cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar, and reduce heat to low.
6. Simmer for 1 hour, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle bubble. Add carrots and continue to simmer, partially covered for another 30 minutes. Using tongs, remove the garlic head and squeeze over the stew to release the cloves. 
7. Stir in the chickpeas and spinach and cook until spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes. 
8. Add cilantro and lemon juice and season stew with salt and pepper, to taste. 
9. Garnish with yogurt and cilantro.
