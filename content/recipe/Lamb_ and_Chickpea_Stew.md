#### INGREDIENTS

* 1 lb Boneless Lamb Shoulder, trimmed of fat and cut into ¾ inch pieces (or 1 lb Beef Chuck) 
* 1 Garlic Head 
* 2 tbsp Salted Butter
* 1 Large Yellow Onion, diced 
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 6 cup Water
* 2 to 3 medium Carrots, peeled, halved lengthwise and cut crosswise into ½-inch pieces

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a bowl, stir together paprika, cumin, cardamom, cinnamon, 2 tsp salt and 1 tsp. pepper. Reserve half of the spice mixture, then toss the lamb with the rest until well coated. Set aside. 
2. Cut off and discard the top third of the garlic head, leaving the head intact. 
3. In a large dutch oven, over medium high, melt the butter. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, until softened and just beginning to brown around the edges, 5 to 8 minutes.
4. Add the tomato paste and the reserved spice mixture, then cook, stirring constantly for 1 minute. Add the water and bring to a boil over high, then add the lamb and garlic head, cut side down. 
5. Cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar, and reduce heat to low.
6. Simmer for 1 hour, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle bubble. Add the carrots and continue to simmer, partially covered for another 30 minutes. Using tongs, remove the garlic head and squeeze over the stew to release the cloves. 
7. Stir in the chickpeas and spinach and cook until spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes. 
7. Add cilantro and lemon juice and season stew with salt and pepper, to taste. 
8. Serve topped with yogurt and sprinkled with cilantro.
