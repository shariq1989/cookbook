* Chicken 
* Vegetables: I used onions, potatoes, zucchinis, and carrots.

#### Can I freeze Thai curry?
You sure can. First, allow the qeema to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. To prevent freezer burn, you can also layer plastic wrap over the container before securing the lid. Qeema will freeze for up to 2 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, let it defrost in the frige overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your sides.
