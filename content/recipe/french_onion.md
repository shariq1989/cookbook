Adapted from: NYT Sam Sifton 

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 Chuck Roast, about 3 LBS. 
* 2 TSP. Kosher Salt 
* 1½ TSP. Ground Pepper 
* ¼ CUP Flour
* 3 TBSP. Canola Oil 
* 4 TBSP. Unsalted Butter 
* 8-12 Pepperoncinis 
* 2 TBSP. Mayonnaise 
* 2 TSP. Apple Cider Vinegar 
* ½ TSP. Dried Dill 
* ¼ TSP. Sweet Paprika 

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Rub the roast with salt and pepper. Sprinkle flour over the meat and massage it in. 
2. Oil the Instant Pot and saute until the oil begins to smoke. Place the roast in and brown on all sides, 4-5 min. per side, creating a crust. 
3. Add the butter and pepperoncinis to the meat, close the lid, and let it cook for 5 min. 
4. While the roast is cooking, make the ranch dressing. Combine the mayonnaise, vinegar, dill, and paprika in a small bowl and whisk to emulsify. 
5. Remove the lid and add the dressing and allow it all to cook for 2 hours. 
6. Shred the meat and mix it with the gravy in the instant pot. 
7. Garnish with parsley and serve with egg noodles or roasted potatoes. You could even put it on a sandwich roll and dip it in Au Jus.
