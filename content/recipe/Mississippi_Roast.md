Servings: 6-8 <!--more-->

Preparation Time: 10 minutes  

Cooking Time: 1 hour, 20 minutes 

Cuisine: American 

#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Roast: 

* 3 lb Chuck Roast 
* 2 tsp Kosher Salt 
* 1½ tsp Coarse Black Pepper  
* ¼ cup Flour
* 1 1/2 tbsp Canola Oil 
* 4 tbsp Unsalted Butter 
* 12-14 Pepperoncinis 
* 1 cup Baby Carrots
* 1/2 Yellow Onion, finely sliced
* Fresh Parsley, finely chopped, to garnish

For the Ranch Dressing: 

* 2 tbsp Mayonnaise 
* 2 tsp Apple Cider Vinegar 
* ½ tsp Fresh Dill, finely chopped
* ¼ tsp Paprika 

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a small bowl, mix the flour, salt, and pepper. Rub the roast with the seasoning.
2. Add oil to an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) on saute mode until it begins to smoke. Then, add the roast and brown the meat on all sides, 4-5 minutes per side, creating a crust. 
3. Add the butter and pepperoncini and place the lid on the pot- do not seal. Let it simmer for 5 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, prepare the ranch dressing. Combine the mayonnaise, vinegar, dill, and paprika in a small bowl and whisk to emulsify. 
5. Remove the lid and add the ranch dressing, carrots, and onions. 
6. Secure the lid, and set the Instant Pot to manual high pressure. Allow the meat to cook for 70 minutes with a quick release. This cooking time is for high elevation. You can reduce the cooking time for lower elevation, though it needs to cook long enough to shred easily. Let it rest, about 5 minutes.
7. Remove the roast and shred it, then mix it with some of the liquid from inside the Instant Pot.
7. Garnish the meat with parsley and serve it as a roast, or throw it on a hoagie with provolone cheese and a side of au jus. 

### ABOUT THE MEAL

It's midweek, and you need a quick and easy meal. Reach for this Mississippi Roast; you won't be disappointed. It has both sweet and savory notes the whole family will enjoy. 

#### Where does Mississippi roast originate?

I love a solid roast, but even more so because the original recipe began with a woman making food in her home. Hey, that sounds familiar. Back then, it didn't have the name Mississippi roast, but as it took the internet by storm, the name followed. 

#### What main ingredients do you need for this meal?

* Chuck Roast: Chuck roast is often the main ingredient of a Mississippi. I like chuck roast for this dish because it is inexpensive and holds up well in the cooking process. It takes a while to cook to make it easy enough to pull, but it will also feed a crowd.

* Ranch Dressing: Ranch is critical to a good Mississippi roast. I love the mayo, dill, and vinegar together; this ranch is a solid combination of both fat and acid, and the addition of the paprika lends a savory note. 

* Pepperoncini: I suggest adding 10-14 peppers to the dish, but if my family gave me the go-ahead, I would add even more. I love the pepperoncini's, especially after they've marinated in the liquid from the meat and ranch dressing. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* 2 small bowls
* An [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rOOdWW)

#### Is Mississippi roast keto? Is Mississippi roast low-carb?

Yes, it is. My suggestion would be to omit the flour from the recipe. You can still season the chuck roast with salt and pepper and sear it without the flour. I calculated the macros for the Mississippi roast to make it easier for you.  

* CARBS – 3 Net Carbs

#### Can I freeze Mississippi Roast? 

Yes, first allow the meat to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe bag. The Mississippi will freeze for up to 6 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your sides.
