#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Roast: 

* 3 lb Chuck Roast 
* 2 tsp Kosher Salt 
* 1½ tsp Coarse Pepper, ground 
* ¼ cup Flour
* 1 1/2 tbsp Canola Oil 
* 4 tbsp Unsalted Butter 
* 8-12 Pepperoncinis 
* 1 cup Baby Carrots
* 1/2 Yellow Onions, finely sliced
* 5 Red Potatoes, quartered and roasted in the oven with 1/2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp minced garlic, salt, and dried parsley. 
* Fresh Parsley, finely chopped, to garnish

For the Ranch Dressing: 

* 2 tbsp Mayonnaise 
* 2 tsp Apple Cider Vinegar 
* ½ tsp Fresh Dill, finely chopped
* ¼ tsp Sweet Paprika 

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a small bowl, mix together the flour, salt, and pepper. Rub roast with the mixture, massaging it in. 
2. Add oil to the Instant Pot or pressure cooker on saute mode until it begins to smoke. Add the roast and brown the meat on all sides, 4-5 minutes per side to create a crust. 
3. Add butter and pepperoncinis and place the lid on the pot (do not seal). Let it cook for 5 minutes. 
4. Prepare the ranch dressing. Combine the mayonnaise, vinegar, dill, and paprika in a small bowl and whisk to emulsify. 
5. Remove the lid and add the dressing, carrots, and onions. Secure the lid and set the Instant Pot to high pressure, cook for 70 minutes with a quick release. (This is for high elevation. You can reduce the cooking time for lower elevation). Let it rest, about 5 minutes. 
6. Remove the roast and shred it, then mix it with the liquid from inside the Instant Pot. 
7. Garnish with parsley and serve with roasted potatoes.
