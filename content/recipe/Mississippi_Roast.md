#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Roast: 

* 3 Lbs. Chuck Roast 
* 2 Tsp. Kosher Salt 
* 1½ Tsp. Pepper, ground 
* ¼ Cup Flour
* 3 Tbsp. Canola Oil 
* 4 Tbsp. Unsalted Butter 
* 8-12 Pepperoncinis 
* Optional: 1 Package Egg Noodles or 5 Red Potatoes, quartered and roasted in the oven. 
* Garnish: Fresh Parsley, choppped

For the Ranch Dressing: 

* 2 Tbsp. Mayonnaise 
* 2 Tsp. Apple Cider Vinegar 
* ½ Tsp. Dried Dill 
* ¼ Tsp. Sweet Paprika 

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. Rub roast with salt and pepper. Sprinkle flour over the meat and massage it in. 
2. Oil the Instant Pot or pressure cooker and saute until the oil begins to smoke. Add the roast and brown the meat on all sides, 4-5 min. per side, creating a crust. 
3. Add butter and pepperoncinis to the meat, close the lid (do not seal), and let it cook for 5 min. 
4. While the roast is cooking, make the ranch dressing. Combine mayonnaise, vinegar, dill, and paprika in a small bowl and whisk to emulsify. 
5. Remove the lid and add the dressing and allow it all to cook on high pressure for 70 min. (This is for high elevation. You can reduce the cooking time for lower elevation). 
6. Shred the meat and mix it with the gravy inside the instant pot. 
7. Garnish with parsley and serve with egg noodles or roasted potatoes. You could even put it on a sandwich roll and dip it in Au Jus.
