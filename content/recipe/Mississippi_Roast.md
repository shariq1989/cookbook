Adapted from: New York Times, Sam Sifton 

#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Roast: 

* 3 lb Chuck Roast 
* 2 tsp Kosher Salt 
* 1½ tsp Coarse Pepper, ground 
* ¼ cup Flour
* 3 tbsp Canola Oil 
* 4 tbsp Unsalted Butter 
* 8-12 Pepperoncinis 
* 5 Red Potatoes, quartered and roasted in the oven with olive oil, salt, and dried parsley. 
* Fresh Parsley, chopped, to garnish

For the Ranch Dressing: 

* 2 tbsp Mayonnaise 
* 2 tsp Apple Cider Vinegar 
* ½ tsp Fresh Dill, finely chopped
* ¼ tsp Sweet Paprika 

#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a small bowl, mix together the flour, salt, and pepper. Rub roast with the mixture, massaging it in. 
2. Add oil to the Instant Pot or pressure cooker on saute mode until it begins to smoke. Add the roast and brown the meat on all sides, 4-5 minutes per side to create a crust. 
3. Add butter and pepperoncinis and place the lid on the pot lid (do not seal). Let it cook for 5 minutes. 
4. Prepare the ranch dressing. Combine the mayonnaise, vinegar, dill, and paprika in a small bowl and whisk to emulsify. 
5. Remove the lid and add the dressing. Secure the lid and set the Instant Pot to high pressure, cook for 70 minutes. (This is for high elevation. You can reduce the cooking time for lower elevation). Let it rest, about 5 minutes. 
6. Shred the meat and mix it with the liquid inside the Instant Pot. 
7. Garnish with parsley and serve with roasted potatoes.
