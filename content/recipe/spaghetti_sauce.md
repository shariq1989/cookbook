### ABOUT THE MEAL

If you're looking for an easy spaghetti sauce, using ingredients you likely have in your pantry already, you need to try this! This recipe is a dinner staple in our family. Even my husband, who is not a fan of tomato-based sauce of any kind, raves about this spaghetti.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Ground Beef: I use ground beef most often, but you could also use ground turkey or a combination of the two. 

* Onion and Garlic 

* Spices: For this sauce, we use dried basil and oregano, chili flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. 

* Tomato Sauce: I buy the plain tomato sauce with nothing else added. You could also make your own from scratch beforehand using fresh tomatoes. 

* Fish Sauce: This may not be an ingredient you would typically add to a spaghetti sauce, but don't skip it. It brings so much richness and flavor to the dish. 

* Herbs: I cook fresh parsley into the sauce and top it with fresh basil.

#### Can I freeze the spaghetti sauce?

You sure can.  In fact, it is encouraged. I often make this recipe in bulk to freeze the extra sauce for a quick meal down the road. First, allow the sauce to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag, careful to remove as much air as possible. The spaghetti sauce will freeze for up to 6 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, defrost the sauce in the refrigerator overnight and warm it on the stove-top while you prepare the noodles.
