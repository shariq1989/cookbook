### About the Meal 

If you're looking for an easy weeknight spaghetti sauce, using ingredients you have in your pantry, be sure to try this recipe. This sauce is a dinner staple in our family. Even my husband, who dislikes tomatoes, raves about this spaghetti sauce. It could have something to do with a few of the secret ingredients I use; whatever it is, I hope you enjoy this spaghetti sauce our family loves. 

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Ground Beef: I use ground beef most often, but you could also use ground turkey or a combination of the two. 

* Onion and Garlic 

* Spices: For the sauce, I use dried basil and oregano, chili flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. 

* [Tomato Sauce](https://amzn.to/3xLODRC): I buy the plain tomato sauce with nothing else added. You could also make your own from scratch beforehand using fresh tomatoes. 

* [Fish Sauce](https://amzn.to/3occMh8): This may not be an ingredient you would typically add to a spaghetti sauce, but don't sleep on it. Fish sauce brings richness and flavor to the dish. 

* Herbs: I cook fresh parsley into the sauce and top it with fresh basil. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [saute pan](https://amzn.to/3gFYnWP) 
* A small bowl 
* A [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/2TLab0X)

#### Can I freeze spaghetti sauce?

You sure can. In fact, it is encouraged. I often make this recipe in bulk so I can freeze the extra sauce for a quick meal down the road. First, allow the sauce to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag, careful to remove as much air as possible. The spaghetti sauce will freeze for up to 6 months. When youâ€™re ready to eat, defrost the sauce in the fride overnight and warm it on the stove-top while you prepare the noodles.
