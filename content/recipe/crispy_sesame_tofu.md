For the Tofu: 

1. Pat dry the tofu with a towel and cut the tofu into rectangles. Season them lightly with salt and set them aside.

3. Whisk the tapioca flour and water together in another bowl. 
4. Dip the tofu slices, one at a time, into the tapioca mixture; coat well. Then, dip the tofu into the bowl with the panko mixture. Be sure to coat the tofu well on all sides, then move to a wire rack. Repeat with remaining tofu slices.

For the Frying:
