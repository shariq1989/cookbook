#### INSTRUCTIONS 

For the Dressing: 

1. In a small bowl, whisk together the coconut milk, lime zest, chili paste, chili oil, and brown sugar until sugar dissolves completely. Slowly pour in the sesame oil and whisk until creamy. 

For the Tofu: 

1. Pat dry the tofu with a paper towel and cut the tofu into rectangles. Season them lightly with salt and set them aside. 
2. In a small bowl, mix the panko, sesame seeds, black pepper, and chili flakes. Pour this mixture into a small skillet with 1 tsp of sesame oil. Toast for 2-4 minutes. 
3. Whisk the tapioca flour and water together in another bowl. 
4. Dip the tofu slices, one at a time, into the tapioca mixture; coat well. Then, dip the tofu into the bowl with the panko mixture. Be sure to coat the tofu well on all sides, then move to a plate. Repeat with remaining tofu slices.

For the Frying: 

1. Set a wire rack into the rimmed baking sheet.
2. Heat 1/4 cup oil in a cast-iron or stainless-steel skillet over medium-low heat. 
3. Test the oil heat by frying one tofu slice, adjust the heat accordingly. 
4. Then small batches, pan-fry the tofu until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Then, transfer the tofu slices to the rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining tofu. 
5. Allow the tofu slices to cool on the wire rack. 
6. To garnish, drizzle with the coconut dressing and serve with steamed jasmine rice, steamed broccoli, or steamed mixed vegetables as we did.
