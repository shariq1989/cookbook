#### DIRECTIONS 

1. In a small bowl, combine salt, cumin, ancho chili, and black pepper to create a rub. 
2. Remove skins and bones from the pork. Cut meat into 1-2 inch pieces. Add rub mixture to the meat. 
3. Select saute mode on the Instant Pot and add the meat to brown. Repeat this until all the meat has had a chance to saute and brown. 
4. Place all of the meat back into the Instant Pot along with onion, garlic, jalapeno, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, orange juice, lime juice, and liquid smoke (2 taps). 
5. Cook on High Pressure for 40 minutes and allow 20 minutes natural release. 
6. Shred meat and spread onto a rimmed baking sheet. 
7. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
8. Cover meat with liquid smoke (to taste) and cook for 4 minutes or until you begin to see crispy bits, depending on your oven. 
9. Serve with warm corn tortillas and garnish with diced onions and cilantro.
