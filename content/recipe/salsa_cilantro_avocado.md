### ABOUT THE SIDE

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Roma Tomatoes: Romas are great for making salsa because they are tougher have fewer seeds than other types of tomatoes; this makes the salsa less watery which is what we're going for with this salsa. 

* Jalapenos: When making this salsa for large groups of people, jalapenos are my pepper of choice. If you love jalapenos but you're craving more of a spice, leave e the seeds and membranes intact when chopping them.  I also change it up once in a while and use serrano chili instead, to add a bite to the salsa. 

* Red Onion 

* Avocado 


#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A large mixing bowl 

#### How do I store leftover salsa? 

On the off chance you have leftover salsa, store it in the refrigerator for 2-4 days.
