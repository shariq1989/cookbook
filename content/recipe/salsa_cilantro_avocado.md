### ABOUT THE SIDE

Skip going to the store and make your own chunky salsa at home. This homemade salsa is packed full of your favorites like tomatoes, onion, garlic, jalapenos, and cilantro. I hope you enjoy this fresh salsa recipe our family loves.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Roma Tomatoes: Romas work well for making salsa; they hold up well and have fewer seeds than other types of tomatoes; this makes the salsa less watery, which is what we're going for with this salsa. 

* Avocado: Avocado takes this salsa to the next level. 

* Cilantro: This highly debated herb flavors the side, but leave it out if it's not your thing. 

* Jalapenos: When making this salsa for large groups of people, jalapenos are my pepper of choice since they're not a spicy as others. If you love jalapenos but crave more spice, leave more of the seeds and membrane intact when chopping them.  I change it up once in a while and use serrano chili to add a bite. 

* Garlic 

* Red Onion 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3cSUCe6) 

#### How can I adjust the spice level of the salsa? 
Full disclosure, I think this salsa is pretty mild. I make it for my toddlers, and they devour it with ease, but I recognize everyone handles spice differently. Here are some suggestions: 

* Too Spicy: If you haven't already, I suggest using only half of the jalapeno. You still get some of the flavors, but not all of the heat. So you have used the whole jalapeno and realized the salsa is too spicy?  I suggest adding a teaspoon or two of granulated white sugar. 

* Too Mild: If you love jalapenos but crave more spice, leave more of the seeds and membrane intact when chopping them. I often use serrano chili to increase the spice level depending on who I am making it for.

#### How do I store leftover salsa? 

On the off chance that you have leftover salsa, store it in a sealed container in the fridge for 2-4 days.
