#### INSTANT POT INSTRUCTIONS 

1. In a small bowl, combine salt, cumin, chipotles en adobo sauce, black pepper, cinnamon, and oregano to create a rub. 
2. Remove skins and bones from the pork and then cut the meat into 1-2 inch pieces. In a [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3nYw3CP), massage the rub into the pork. 
3. Heat oil on saute mode in an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ). Add the meat and let it cook until it begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Repeat until all the pork has had a chance to cook. Set aside. 
4. Place the meat back into the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ), along with the onion, garlic, jalapeno, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, orange juice, lime juice, and liquid smoke (2 taps). 
5. Secure the lid and cook on manual high pressure for 40 minutes. Allow 20 minutes for natural release. 
6. Remove the pork from the [Instant Pot] using a slotted spoon, leaving the juices behind. Allow the meat to cool some before shredding it, and then spread it onto a [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3kNBH9a). 
7. Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees.
8. Cover the meat with liquid smoke (to taste) and cook for 4 minutes, until you begin to see crispy bits, and depending on your oven. The more crispy bits, the better. You may even want to move the meat around and repeat this process a few times based on personal preference. 
9. Serve on warm corn tortillas and garnish with onions and cilantro. This meal pairs well with our [Mexican rice](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/mexican_rice/).

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

Carnitas, or "little meat," is a popular Mexican dish of braised pork shoulder that is later pulled apart and then crisped up. This carnitas recipe makes for the perfect street taco- the juicy, shredded pork, and the crispy, flavorful edges, all made in the comfort of your own home. 

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Carnitas Rub: I use salt, cumin, chipotles en adobo, black pepper, cinnamon, Mexican oregano, and avocado oil. 

* Pork Shoulder: Pork shoulder is ideal for carnitas. The higher fat content helps the meat maintain its tender juiciness throughout the cooking process. 

* Onion

* Garlic 

* Jalapeno 

* Aromatics: I use a cinnamon stick and bay leaves. 

* Orange juice: The orange juice tenderizes the pork and flavors the dish. 

* Lime 

* [Liquid Smoke]: This is a key ingredient for my carnitas. If you want smoky flavored pork without the long smoking process, liqid smoke is a game-changer. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A small bowl 
* A [mixing bowl](https://amzn.to/3nYw3CP)
* An [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ)
* A [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3kNBH9a)

#### Are carnitas keto? Are they low-carb?

Yes, replace the orange juice with water and add 1 tsp of [Chicken Better than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/2P3CipM) for added flavor. These macros account for the pork in the taco and not the tortilla or any the toppings.  The serving size for this dish is three tacos. 

* CARBS – 2 Net Carbs 
* PROTEIN – 44g
* FAT – 38g

We recommend serving the carnitas with a low-carb tortilla. I like Mr. Tortilla because they are only 1 Net Carb per tortilla.  I tried to link them for you, but only the bulk order option was available on Amazon affiliates.

#### What can I do with the leftover meat? 

Don't feel like making tacos for the second night in a row? No worries, use the leftover meat to make enchiladas, nachos, sliders, quesadillas, breakfast burritos, or Mexican pizza. 

#### Can I freeze carnitas?

You sure can. For best results, reserve some meat and juice before broiling. I prefer to put the pork into a freezer-safe container or bag and store the reserved juices separately in another bag. The carnitas will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let both defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, pour the contents of the  bag into a bowl and warm it in the microwave for thirty seconds. Reheat the carnitas by frying them in a [cast-iron skillet](https://amzn.to/3leoB4I) or [frying pan](https://amzn.to/3xsBEUW). When the pork is thoroughly reheated, drizzle the meat with the reserved juices. Prepare your tortillas and toppings, and enjoy!
