### How to Make Vegetarian Eggs Benedict: 

#### INGREDIENTS 

For the Hollandaise Sauce: 

* 1 stick Butter, unsalted
* 3 Egg Yolks
* 1 tbsp Lemon Juice
* 1/2 tsp Kosher Salt
* 1/4 tsp Cayenne Pepper
  
For the Poached Eggs: 

* 4 large Eggs
* 1 tbsp Distilled White Vinegar

For the Greens: 

* 1 tbsp Avocado Oil 
* 1 cup Spinach 
* 1 cup Arugula 
* 1 tsp Mustard Seeds 
* 1/2 tsp Salt 
* 1/2 tsp Red Chili Flakes 
* 1 Avocado, sliced

#### INSTRUCTIONS

For the Hollandaise Sauce:

1. In a [microwave-safe dish](https://amzn.to/3GGi0cg), microwave the butter. 
2. Once hot, slowly whisk the egg yolks into the butter until emulsified. 
3. Next, add the lemon juice, salt, and cayenne powder. 
4. Set aside. 

For the Poached Eggs: 

1. Crack an egg into a small [sieve](https://amzn.to/31d0Q5K) over the same bowl with the egg whites from the hollandaise sauce. Do this to remove the excess egg white. Then, place the eggs into a [ramekin](https://amzn.to/3jTAxYH).
2. Bring a [sauce pan](https://amzn.to/3nQrTLL) of water, 4 inches deep, to a boil.
3. Stir the vinegar into the water and swirl the pot. While the water is still moving, add the eggs and let them cook for 3 minutes.
4. While the eggs are cooking, set a [trivet](https://amzn.to/3w7fneK) over the boiling water and place the reserved hollandaise mixture onto the trivet. Continue whisking the hollandaise sauce while eggs cook below.  

For the  Greens: 

1. Warm  1 tsp avocado oil in a small [skillet](https://amzn.to/3jYY8r3). 
2. Add the mustard seeds and cook until they begin to sputter. 
3. In a small bowl, toss the arugula and spinach with the remaining avocado oil. 
4. Add the greens to the saute pan and cook until they become wilted, 3 minutes. 
5. Before removing from heat, stir in the salt and red chili flakes until combined. 
6. Plate the greens and top with sliced avocado. 

To Serve: 

1. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and set them onto the plated greens.
2. Top with hollandaise sauce, and enjoy right away!
