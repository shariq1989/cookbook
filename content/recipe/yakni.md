Servings: 5 <!--more-->

Preparation Time: 10 minutes 

Cooking Time: 1 hour, 10 minutes 

Cuisine: Indian, Pakistani  

#### INGREDIENTS 

* 1 tbsp [Ghee](https://amzn.to/3vmpBaf)
* 1 Yellow Onion, diced 
* 3-5 Garlic Cloved, minced
* Fresh Ginger, 1-inch piece, julienne 
* 1 Cinnamon Stick 
* 1 Thai Green Chili, slit lengthwise
* 3 Black Cardamom Pods, lightly crushed 
* 2 Green Cardamom Pods
* 3 Cloves 
* 1 tbsp Cumin Seeds 
* 1 tsp Coriander Seeds 
* 1 Star Anise 
* 2 Bay Leaves 
* 1 tsp Salt 
* 1 lb Goat, cut into 1-inch pieces, bone-in, plus extra bones if you have them 
* 4 cup Water 

#### DIRECTIONS 
1. In the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qLtTEw), warm the ghee on saute mode. Then add the onions and cook until they become translucent and soften. 
2. While the onions are cooking, add the spices, apart from salt, to the [spice infuser](https://amzn.to/38zcQ2w). Set aside. 
3. Add the garlic, ginger, green chili, and cinnamon stick to the Instant Pot and let it cook until aromatic. 
4. Next, add the goat and let it fry, stirring continuously, for about 1 minute. 
5. Combine the water and salt with the other ingredients and stir. 
6. Lastly, add the spice infuser to the Instant Pot, secure the lid, and cook on manual high pressure for 1 hour with a quick release. 
7. Using a colander or strainer, pour the yakhni into a large serving bowl. Toss the cinnamon stick, the spices inside the spice infuser, and any ingredients left behind in the straining process. 
8. You will have tender goat pieces after making the soup; we prefer to reserve them separately to make Yakhni Pulao. If you decide to make pulao, you should also save 1 cup of yakhni soup. Do not store it in the same dish as the goat. 
9. Add the soup to a bowl or a nice mug, garnish with extra ginger pieces and enjoy.  

### ABOUT THE MEAL 

I was not keen on the idea of yakhni when my mother-in-law first offered to make it for me. I was pregnant with our daughter, and I had been hospitalized twice due to sickness and dehydration.  I couldn't keep down any food because almost everything I tried to eat made me nauseous. I finally gave in and let her make it for me, and I am forever grateful. It ended up being a meal I ate daily throughout my pregnancy. My mother-in-law would make it in large batches and freeze it for me when she would come to visit. Even now, there are few things more comforting than a steaming bowl of Yakhni. 

Before meeting Shariq, I had no experience with Desi food. If you asked me the difference between an Indian or a Thai Curry, I couldn’t have told you, so learning how to cook Indian food is near and dear to my heart. It’s been an honor to study Desi cooking under my talented mother-in-law. She prepares food off-script; you have to watch her closely as she buzzes through the kitchen, or you miss it all. I am amazed by her ability to build upon flavors and create masterpiece after masterpiece. This recipe is inspired by what I have learned cooking alongside her.

#### What main ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Bones: The main ingredient of yakhni are the nutrients that come from bones, so as long as you have bones, it will be tasty. We prefer goat meat and bones because we re-purpose the goat meat to make a separate dish, called yakhni pulao. Essentially, we get two meals out of one. 

* Yakhni Masala: I make homemade yakhni masala with whole spices. I sometimes play with the blend, but this one is always tasty: Black Cardamon Pods, Green Cardamon Pods, 4 Cloves, Cumin Seeds, Coriander Seeds, Star Anise, Bay Leaves, and Salt.   

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* An [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3rJtgwM)
* A [spice infuser](https://amzn.to/3lhIYN1)
* A colander or strainer 
* A large bowl 

#### Is this soup keto? Is this soup lowcarb?

Yakhni pulao is keto and low-carb and packed full of nutrients that help with the common keto flu. We even calculated the macros to make it easier for you. 

* CARBS– 2 Net Carbs
* PROTEIN– 25g
* FAT– 8g

If you fully strain the onions, the net carbs drop to 1g.

#### What is Yakhni good for? 

Yakhni is highly nutritious and a meal all on its own. It has soothing qualities, helpful for people with colds, stomachaches, and morning sickness well. The meat and spices marinate to create the soup, leaving it tasty and mineral-dense. Because of the bones, the soup also contains collagen, which is crucial for hair and nail health, as well as joint wellness.

#### Can I freeze the Yakni?

You sure can. As I mentioned, my mother-in-law often made multiple batches of yakhni soup and froze them for me before teaching me how to make it on my own. First, allow the yakhni to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container. I prefer to freeze it in individual containers to make defrosting it easier. Yakhni can freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it in the microwave and enjoy.
