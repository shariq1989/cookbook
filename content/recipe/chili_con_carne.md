#### INSTANT POT INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Add the dried chilis to an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) and cook on saute mode until blistered, 1 minute.  
2. Remove the chilis and add them to a [food processor](https://amzn.to/3bUKS2q) or [blender](https://amzn.to/3H5anfT), along with the chicken broth. Add 2 of the chipotle chilis and 2 tbsp of the sauce from the can. Mix thoroughly and set aside.
3. Season the chuck with salt and pepper. 
4. Add oil to the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) and then add a layer of beef chuck. Allow it to sear and form a crust. Repeat until all the meat has had a chance to brown. Set the meat aside. 
5. Add onions to the oil and cook until they become translucent and soften.
6. Next, add the garlic, cinnamon, cumin, allspice, and Mexican oregano. Stir to combine, and then cook until it becomes fragrant about 1-2 minutes.  
7. Add the reserved meat and chili puree, along with Worcestershire sauce, apple cider vinegar, fish sauce, black beans, and tomato paste in the [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ). 
8. Secure the lid and cook on manual high pressure for 40 minutes.

### ABOUT THE MEAL 


#### Chili Con Carne Origin: 

Chili con carne appears to have originated in Texas and currently holds the title of, The State Dish of Texas. It is said that chili was brought to San Antonio by immigrants from Canary Island. 

#### Chili Con Carne Ingredients: 

In the development of recipes, I try out different ingredients to find the right combination. The same is true of our chili con carne. After testing variations of the highly-debated ingredients, we favored beef chuck and black beans overall. The tenderness of the chuck cooked alongside the beans and chili makes for the best chili con carne recipe I have ever tried; it achieves a heartiness that is missing with other meat options. However, the real star of this dish, in my opinion, isn't the meat or beans, but the variety of chilis used- they flavor the rest of the dish without overwhelming the chili with heat.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* An [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ)
* A [food processor](https://amzn.to/3bUKS2q) or [blender](https://amzn.to/3H5anfT)

#### Can I make chili con carne vegetarian? Can I make vegan chili con carne?

I know what you're thinking, "meat" is in the title, stick with me. You can completely make chili con carne vegetarian and vegan with a few substitutions. 

In place of the meat, use potatoes, cauliflower, and other vegetables, or simply double the number of black beans in the recipe. Replace the chicken broth with your favorite vegetable broth, and use Marmite instead of fish sauce. Skip the Worcestershire since it has trace amounts of anchovy in it; not having it won't alter the recipe too much.  

#### Is chili con carne keto or low-carb?

Served as a stew without beans and paired with a low-carb [tortilla](https://amzn.to/3ePAoDU), it sure is! We calculated the macros to make it easier for you. Please note, this calculation was made without the beans and does not include any of the toppings or a tortilla. The serving size is 1 1/2 cup of stew.

#### What is chili con carne traditionally served with? 

Like the dish itself, this too is highly debated. We enjoy our chili con carne as a stew topped with onion, shredded cheese, cilantro, avocado, and thinly sliced chilis. Our meal is made complete with warm corn tortillas. 

Because chili con carne ingredients are so widely disputed, there is room to serve it however you would like. As a stew, you can pair the chili with corn tortillas like we do or opt for tortilla chips, flour tortillas, or cornbread. Hey, this is the Texas state dish afterall. I have even seen chili con carne served over rice or macaroni noodles. You could also pair it with a side of [Mexican Rice](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/mexican_rice/). The moral of the story is, get creative, and adjust the meal to your family's preference. Either way, we know it is a meal you and those around you will enjoy.  

#### Can I freeze chili con carne?

You sure can. First, allow the dish to cool completely. Then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. Chili con carne will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm the stew on the stovetop and prepare all of your toppings.
