Long before our kiddos, when Shariq and I were engaged, we did the whole long-distance thing. He lived in Colorado with his roommate, and I was still in Arizona.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Beef Short Ribs: I prefer how tender the beef short ribs turn out, but stew meat will work just fine for this meal. Be sure to adjust the cooking time accordingly, as stew meat will take longer to become tender. 

* Onion 

* Garlic 

* Mushrooms: I use Bella; any mushroom will do, or you can skip them altogether. 

* Cream of Mushroom 

* Onion Soup Mix 

* Egg Noodles 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?
