### ABOUT THE MEAL

Gulasch or goulash originated in Hungary. Today, it has evolved into unique dishes from all over the world. This particular recipe is for an Austrian beef goulash or Austrian beef stew. It is flavored traditionally with caraway and paprika, and the beef is cooked until it is soft and tender. The result of this recipe is the dark, smooth, and flavorful gravy you expect from rindsgulasch.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Short Rib Roast: I prefer the tenderness of short rib; you can also use chuck roast or a more traditional beef shank. 

* Paprika: Okay, you can probably use whatever paprika you have in the cabinet. But trust me, you will love the flavor derived from the combination of sweet and hot paprika. If you only want to purchase one of them, reach for the sweet paprika and add a teaspoon of cayenne to give it a little kick. 

* Caraway Seeds: Caraway seeds are a main ingredient in rindsgulasch; this spice provides a peppery and citrusy flavor to the dish.  

* Fresh Dill: Largely used as an aromatic, dill pairs well with the beef and spices like caraway. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A small bowl

* An [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) or [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3wIA1Bu)

#### What can I serve alongside rindsgulasch? 

I typically serve rindsgulasch with egg noodles; you could also pair this stew with roasted potatoes, mashed potatoes, or a traditional spätzle. 

#### Can I freeze rindsgulasch?

First, allow the dish to cool completely and the stew to a freezer-safe container or bag. It will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on a stovetop and prepare your sides. 

Note: I would freeze the goulash separately and then prepare fresh noodles when I am ready to eat it again.
