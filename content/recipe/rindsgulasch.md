### ABOUT THE MEAL

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Short Rib Roast: We prefer short rib, but you can also use chuck roast or beef shank. 

* Paprika: Okay, okay, you could probably use whatever paprika you have in the cabinet. But trust me, you will love the flavor that comes from the sweet and hot paprika combination. If you only want to purchase one of them, reach for the sweet paprika and substitute 1 tsp of cayenne instead of the hot paprika. 

* Caraway Seeds

* Onions  

* Fresh Dill

You sure can. First, allow the dish to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container. Rindsgulasch will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it on a stovetop and prepare your sides.
