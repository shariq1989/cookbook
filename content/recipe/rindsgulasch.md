### ABOUT THE MEAL

Gulasch or goulash originated in Hungary. Today, it has evolved into unique dishes from all over the world. This particular recipe is for an Austrian beef goulash or Austrian beef stew, also called rindsgulasch. It is flavored traditionally with caraway and paprika, and the beef is cooked until it is soft and tender. The result of this recipe is a dark, smooth, and flavorful gravy you expect from rindsgulasch.

#### What ingredients are needed for this meal?

* Paprika: Okay, you can probably use whatever paprika you have in the cabinet. But trust me, you will love the flavor from the [Sweet](https://amzn.to/3jJjOGx) and [Hot Paprika](https://amzn.to/2ZeqanW). If you only want to purchase one of them, reach for the sweet paprika, and add a teaspoon of cayenne to give it a little kick. 

* Kosher Salt 

* Black Pepper

* Short Rib Roast: I prefer the tenderness of short rib; you can also use chuck roast, or a more traditional beef shank. 

* Salted Butter

* Yellow Onion

* [Caraway Seeds](https://amzn.to/3b6l7Ls):Caraway seeds are a main ingredient in rindsgulasch; this spice provides a peppery citrus flavor to the dish. 
 
* Garlic 

* Water

* [Beef Better Than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/3qUFukL)

* Tomato Paste 

* Bay Leaves

* Fresh Dill: Largely used as an aromatic, dill pairs well with beef and spices like caraway.

* Apple Cider Vinegar

* Egg Noodles

* Sour Cream 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* A small bowl
* An [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3qfNYCZ) or [Dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3wIA1Bu)

#### What can I serve alongside rindsgulasch? 

I typically serve rindsgulasch with egg noodles; you could also pair it with roasted potatoes, mashed potatoes, or a traditional spätzle. 

#### Can I freeze rindsgulasch?

You sure can. First, allow the dish to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. It will freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on a stovetop and prepare your sides. 

Note: Freeze the goulash separately and then prepare fresh noodles when you're ready to eat it again.
