#### Can I freeze the chorizo burritos? 

You sure can. I like to make a couple of batches so I can freeze breakfast burritos for easy reheat later on. All you have to do is wrap the burritos in plastic wrap, followed by foil. Wrap the burritos individually and store them in a freezer-safe bag. The chorizo burritos can freeze for up to 3 months. To serve, remove the plastic wrap and recover with the foil. Reheat the burritos as is in the oven at 325 degrees until the burritos are warmed through, about 30 minutes.
