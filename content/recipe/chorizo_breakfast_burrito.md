### ABOUT THE MEAL

#### What main ingredients do you need for this meal?

* Chorizo: 

* Eggs 

* Potatoes: You can use Yukon gold or red potatoes. I like to use a combination of the two. 

* Large Flour Tortillas: 

* Cheese: I use shredded cheddar cheese. 

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe?

* 2 Skillets, one with a lid
* A small bowl 

#### Can I freeze the chorizo burritos? 

Yes, you can. What I like to do, is to make a couple of batches so that I can freeze some for easy reheat later on. All you have to do is wrap the burritos in foil individually and store them in a freezer-safe bag. The chorizo burritos can freeze for up to 3 months.

To serve, reheat the burritos uncovered in the oven and 325 degrees until the burritos are warmed through, about 30 minutes.
