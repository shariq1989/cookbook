#### DIRECTIONS 

For the Corn Tortillas: 

1. Set a wire rack into a rimmed baking sheet. 
2. In a small Skillet, warm 1/4 cup of oil over medium-high heat. 
3. When the oil begins to smoke, add the corn tortilla and cook for 15-30 seconds. 
4. Flip and cook the other side, about 10 seconds. 
5. Using tongs, set the tortilla to dry on the wire rack. Repeat until the remaining tortillas have cooked. 

For the Tacos: 
1. Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat. 
2. Add the onions to the pan and cook until they become translucent and soften. 
3. Next, add the ground beef and break it up with a [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/3bQ2coS) or spatula. Cook until beef browns and is heated through, about 10 minutes. 
4. Stir in the garlic and cilantro, and season the meat with garlic powder, salt, and taco seasoning. Mix to combine, and then add water. Cover with a lid and allow the meat to simmer for about 5 minutes. 
5. Spoon the beef into the warmed corn tortillas and top with sour cream, homemade [guacamole](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/guacamole/), cheese, and a few drops of Tapatio. Serve with [Mexican rice](https://www.jamilghar.com/recipe/mexican_rice/), and enjoy.

#### ABOUT THE MEAL)

My family didn’t have a lot of money when I was growing up, so we rotated a few meals throughout the week. One dish I always looked forward to my mom making was her ground beef tacos. I must have passed this joy onto my son because this is his most requested meal from me. He is the reason I decided to post this recipe because he very genuinely told me the other day, “mama, people need to know how to make this meal so they can feed it to their kids.” Well, we certainly hope you enough this easy weeknight meal as much as we do. 

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Ground Beef: I like to use lean ground beef because the fattier cuts of ground beef change the taste dramatically. 

* Aromatics: I use onion and garlic. 

* Seasoning: I know I could have made a taco seasoning from scratch to make my mom's dish more original. I like to use Ortegas taco seasoning, garlic powder, and salt because there is something special about a meal from childhood.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe? 

* A small bowl 
* A skillet
* A [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/3bQ2coS)
* A rimmed baking sheet and a wire rack 
* A heavy-bottomed pan 

#### Can I freeze the beef? 

Yes, first allow the meat to cool completely and then add it to a freezer-safe container. To prevent freezer burn, you can also layer saran wrap over the container before securing the lid. The beef mixture will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your tortillas and toppings.
