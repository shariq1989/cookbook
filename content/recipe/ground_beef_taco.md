#### INSTRUCTIONS 

For the Corn Tortillas:

2. In a small [skillet](https://amzn.to/3qPphRG), warm 1/4 cup of oil over medium-high heat. 
3. When the oil begins to smoke, add the corn tortilla and cook for 15-30 seconds. 
4. Flip and cook the other side, about 10 seconds. 
5. Using tongs, set the tortilla to dry on the [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3qP6fL9). Repeat with the remaining tortillas.  

For the Tacos: 
1. Heat oil in a [saute pan](https://amzn.to/3oE3WYv) over medium heat.

3. Next, add the ground beef and break it up with a [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/3bQ2coS); cook until browned and heated through for about 10 minutes. 
4. Stir in the garlic and cilantro, and season the meat with garlic powder, salt, and taco seasoning. Mix to combine. Cover and allow the meat to simmer for about 5 minutes.

### ABOUT THE MEAL

My family didn’t have money growing up, and we rotated a few meals throughout the week. One dish I always looked forward to my mom making was ground beef tacos. I must have passed this joy onto my son because this is his most requested meal. He is the reason I decided to post this recipe; he very genuinely told me the other day, “Mama, people need to know how to make this meal so they can feed it to their kids.”  

Well, we certainly hope you enjoy this easy ground beef taco meal as much as we do.

#### What main ingredients do I need for this meal?

* Ground Beef: I use lean ground beef. 

* Onion 

* Garlic 

* Cilantro 

* Taco Seasoning: I know I could have made taco seasoning from scratch to make my mom's dish more original and unique, but I decided to reach for Ortegas taco seasoning, garlic powder, and salt like she did because there is something special about a meal from childhood, even if it is simple.

#### What equipment do I need to make this recipe? 

For the Corn Tortillas: 
* A [rimmed baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3Cvqcsq)
* A [wire rack](https://amzn.to/3qP6fL9) 
* A [skillet](https://amzn.to/3qPphRG)

For the Tacos: 
* A small bowl 
* A [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/3bQ2coS)
* A [saute pan](https://amzn.to/3oE3WYv)

#### Can I freeze cooked ground beef? 

Yes, you can. First, allow the meat to cool completely, and then add it to a freezer-safe container or bag. To prevent freezer burn, layer plastic wrap over the container before securing the lid. The ground beef will freeze for up to 2 months. When you’re ready to eat, let it defrost in the fridge overnight. To serve, warm it on the stove and prepare your tortillas and toppings.
