#### DIRECTIONS 

For the Guacamole:

1. In a bowl, mash together the avocados, lime juice, and salt. 
2. Then stir in the cilantro and season with garlic powder to serve. 

For the Corn Tortillas: 

1. Set a wire rack into a rimmed baking sheet. 
2. In a small Skillet, warm 1/4 cup of oil over medium high- heat. 
3. When the oil begins to smoke, add the corn tortilla and cook for 15-30 seconds. 
4. Flip and cook the other side, about 10 seconds. 
5. Using tongs, set the tortilla to dry on the wire rack. Repeat until the remaining tortillas have cooked. 

For the Tacos: 

1. Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat. 
2. Add the onions to the pan and cook until onions become translucent and soften. 
3. Next, add the ground beef and break it up with a [meat chopper](https://amzn.to/3bQ2coS) or spatula. Cook, stirring occasionally until beef is heated thoroughly and becomes brown about 7-10 minutes. 
4. Stir in the minced garlic and cilantro and then add the water. 
5. Season the meat with garlic powder, salt, and taco seasoning. Stir to combine. Allow the mixture to simmer, about 5 minutes. 
6. Spoon the beef into the warmed corn tortillas and top with sour cream, guacamole, cheese, and a few drops of Tapatio. Serve immediately.

#### ABOUT THE STORY

We didn't have a lot of money growing up, but one meal I always looked forward to was my mom's beef tacos. You could easily mix an original taco seasoning to elevate the dish, but there is something homey about going back to a meal from childhood, even if it's humble. I must have passed this joy on to my son as this is his most requested meal. He is the very reason I posted this recipe at all. He knows about our website and often tells me what I should and should not post. The other day he told me, "mama, people need to know how to make this meal so they can feed it to their kids.
