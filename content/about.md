{{< figure src="/images/about.png" alt="Shariq and Tressa" class="aboutFigure">}}

Welcome to our table; let's break bread together. 
We'll start, we are Shariq and Tressa, the husband and wife team behind, The Jamil Ghar. We live in beautiful Colorado alongside our two little ones. 
Amidst the chaos and division of the last few years an idea birthed. While as people, we are known more for our differences than our commonalities, we are firm believers that there isn't much that couldn't be solved through conversation around a good meal. 

Shariq was born and raised in a bustling city in Pakistan, whereas Tressa hails from a small town in Utah. Born two worlds away, there is very little we share in common in terms of upbringing. Yet, the appreciation for food and delight in meals shared with family and friends translates to all cultures and people. Thus, this site began. We may not be able to physically invite you into our home to share a meal, but it's our hope that through the recipes and stories we share, this big world feel a bit smaller and more familiar.
