Hey there, welcome to our table. 

We are Shariq and Tressa, the husband and wife team behind, The Jamil Ghar. We live in beautiful North Carolina alongside our two little ones. Shariq works on the development and functionality of the website, whereas I, Tressa, delight in trying and creating delicious recipes for others to enjoy.  

### ABOUT US 

Shariq was born and raised in a busy city, Karachi, Pakistan; I hail from a small town named after a Bullfrog in Utah. Don't check, it's likely not on a map. The two of us were born worlds away and share very little in common in terms of upbringing. Yet, our appreciation for food and our delight in meals shared with others translates to all cultures and people. While as humans, we are known more for our differences than what we have in common, we are firm believers that there isn’t much that couldn’t be solved or understood through conversation around a good meal. We may not be able to physically invite you into our home to share a meal and hear about your life and the food you love, but we hope that through the recipes and stories we share, this big world will feel a bit smaller and more familiar.  

### ABOUT OUR NAME 

Shakespeare had it right when he questioned through the character Romeo, "what's in a name?" In the play Romeo and Juliet, their names dictated everything about their lives and their future. While I am not condoning any of that, I would agree that there is power in a name. There is also power in naming things as they are. 

For that reason, we go by "The Jamil Ghar" in our little corner of the internet. Sure, Jamil is our last name, and that would make sense to use in our branding, but it is so much more than that. In Hindi and Urdu, the word ghar means home, and a direct translation would be The Jamil Home. Going one step further, in Arabic, which is the language our last name derives from, Jamil means beautiful. The Beautiful Home is what our site represents. If you were to stop by our house at 4 pm midweek, you have my full permission to question our naming, trust me. But it is not the cleanliness that makes a home beautiful, nor the addition of nice things. Rather, beautiful homes are comprised by the coming together of people under one roof. Like a good recipe needs a balance of flavor, a beautiful home needs it all too. So join us, as you are, in The Jamil Ghar. It's even more beautiful with you in it. 


Now that you have gotten to know our heart for this website, thank you for joining us. We hope you find joy in the meals our family loves and makes for those who visit our home.
