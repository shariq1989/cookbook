Welcome to our table. 

We are Shariq and Tressa, the husband and wife team behind, The Jamil Ghar. We live in beautiful North Carolina alongside our two little ones. Shariq works on the development and functionality of the website, whereas Tressa delights in trying and creating delicious recipes for others to enjoy.  

Shariq was born and raised in the bustling city of Karachi, Pakistan; Tressa hails from a small town called Bullfrog, Utah. They were born worlds away, and they share very little in common in terms of upbringing. Yet, the appreciation for food and delight in meals shared with others translates to all cultures and people. While as humans, we are known more for our differences than what we have in common, we are firm believers that there isn’t much that couldn’t be solved or understood through conversation around a good meal. We may not be able to physically invite you into our home to share a meal and hear about your life and the food you love, but we hope that through the recipes and stories we share, this big world will feel a bit smaller and more familiar.  

Now that you have gotten to know our heart for this little corner of the internet, thank you for joining us. 
We hope you find delight in the meals our family loves and makes for those who visit our home. 
Get in touch with us by visiting our Instagram page @thejamilghar or through writing a quick email. We appreciate your questions and feedback as we get this site off the ground. 
Don't forget to share the love and tag us when you try one of our recipes. We also have our very own hashtag #thejamilghar. We cannot wait to see what you have made and hear about the conversations you have had around your dinner table.
