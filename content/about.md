Hey there, welcome to our table. 

We are Shariq and Tressa, the husband and wife team behind, The Jamil Ghar. We live in beautiful North Carolina alongside our two little ones. Shariq works on the development and functionality of the website, whereas I, Tressa, delight in trying and creating delicious recipes for others to enjoy.  

Shariq was born and raised in a busy city, Karachi, Pakistan; I hail from a small town named after a Bullfrog in Utah. Don't check, it's likely not on a map. The two of us were born worlds away and share very little in common in terms of upbringing. Yet, our appreciation for food and our delight in meals shared with others translates to all cultures and people. While as humans, we are known more for our differences than what we have in common, we are firm believers that there isn’t much that couldn’t be solved or understood through conversation around a good meal. We may not be able to physically invite you into our home to share a meal and hear about your life and the food you love, but we hope that through the recipes and stories we share, this big world will feel a bit smaller and more familiar.  

### ABOUT OUR NAME 

We go by "The Jamil Ghar" in our little corner of the internet. Sure, Jamil is our last name, so that would make sense for our branding. In Urdu, the word "ghar" means home. In Arabic, which is the language our last name derives from, "jamil" means beautiful. And that is exactly what we hope to represent in this site, a beautiful home. But it is not the cleanliness that makes a home beautiful, nor the addition of nice things. Rather, beautiful homes are comprised by the coming together of people under one roof. Like a good recipe needs a balance of flavor, a beautiful home needs it all too. So join us, as you are, in The Jamil Ghar. It's even more beautiful with you in it.
